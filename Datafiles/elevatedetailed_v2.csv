ENEXAN develops the next generation of EV Charging that will be capable of serving multiple EVs at the same time. Through their innovative design and advanced AI-enabled energy management, ENEXAN EV charging solution boosts satisfaction by adapting charging to customers schedules and eliminating waiting times on site. Comparing to a conventional charging station with comparable equipment costs, the ENEXAN designed and operated charging station comes with considerable increase on revenues. ENEXAN focuses on capturing the market of customized services to EV fleets (e.g. taxi stands, airports’ parking, hotels). The ENEXAN team comprises of engineers with high expertise on AI-enabled systems and working experience in high-tech firms, business and project development partners, and a strong advisory board with top academics and financial consultants. ENEXAN promotes “Intelligence over Equipment” as its business and technological vision for the future of sustainable transportation. 
","ENEXAN's mission is to use Energy Intelligence, instead of more equipment, to deliver superior results with less environmental impact. ENEXAN develops “EV Charging Networks” that serve multiple clients simultaneously. 

ENEXAN’s charging network is empowered by its advanced energy management system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to predict the charging behaviour of EV drivers. This behaviour is anticipated before their arrival at the charging space and it is constantly updated during their stay. The AI predictions can be supplemented with direct input or via a mobile app from the drivers. 
 
We employ Fast Optimization Techniques to schedule the delivery of energy among 10s, 100s or 1000s of Electrical Vehicles. We have designed a smart-hardware system (patent - filed) that is modular, reconfigurable, very economic and allows charging many vehicles from one or more existing (expensive) Fast-Charger.
","ENEXAN provides an innovative Fast EV Charging solution utilizing a proprietary modular and low-cost system called ""ENEXAN Box"". 

ENEXAN's system allows for multiple fast EV-Chargers to connect into a network and supply charging power to multiple charging points which can be easily extended. We have already filed two patents (pending) to protect our technological solution. 

The competitive advantage of the ENEXAN charging network is the capacity to increase extensively the utilization rate of the expensive to install ""Fast EV-Chargers"". This way the investment into a Fast-EV charging system becomes very attractive financially for our customers while it allows them to provide EV charging points at a very large number of their parking spaces compared to other solutions. 

ENEXAN's technology allows for dynamic pricing and prioritization of EVs using an intelligent Back-End that forecasts and prioritizes usage while balancing energy flows. 

An advantage specific to the market of EV charging, is that with our technology the requirement for expensive infrastructure upgrades (Power Network Connection) is eliminated or minimized compared to the competition.

Our unique value proposition lies on the capacity to provide ""Fast EV charging"" at a low cost in locations that this was not considered financially feasible before such as large Parking Spaces, Airport Parking, Hotels, Taxi Stands and Car Rental Agencies, at a large number of parking spots in a financially viable way.","Our team has started developing ENEXAN products and business since October 2020.

The big opportunity here is to create a product that can combine the best of the two worlds, by having a ready made platform and IP while at the same time understanding that a big organisation cannot devote human resources on these solutions, so you have to offer a solid implementation and maintenance plan for your platform.","Our platforms come to solve this problem, offering a clear solution to these organizations.
The chatbot platform consists of three components:
- the chatbot engine 
- the analytics platform 
- the Admin Panel that acts like a CMS and campaign manager 
The most crucial component here is the design of the above solution, being able to be integrated to our clients existing software (CRM, SRM etc) so they help their operations. We are very glad that we are selected by Viber as the go-to company for chatbots in our region.
The second platform consists of also three similar components:
- the training scenarios in either VR/AR or 360 in Unity (4 scenarios already created for fire safety, working in heights, escaping plants and electricity safety measures.)
- the analytics platform 
- the Admin Panel that acts like a CMS and campaign manager 
The most crucial component to our training platform is that organizations can use their own 3D designs or 360 panoramas, as this is crucial for their operations.","Our chatbot platform has a very strong context and intention handler engine and a very friendly adapter to create new flows for viber and messenger. We base our NLP tech in Wit.ai and Markovian chains but we are now working as well with GTP models. We have more than 50million chatbot related data in Greek to make our NLP better by our chatbots. We plan to use the same method for the next languages we are adding or cooperate with local NLP/NLU companies. We are working in Romania we just started working with Viber in Bulgaria.
Our main competitive advantage in our VR platform is that we can integrate our VR functions and scenarios in our client’s environment (3D Model or 360). This was a big part of our Horizon program (XR4All). The program was to use our scenarios and plugins and a scalable way, so we can create training scenarios using our platform and our clients environment.

It focuses on measuring the Business System's profitability as the sum of all its consisting SKU Elements' profitability. With daily updates of a set of simple data, any ERP can provide and build a trusted Information Black-Box for the Past and Present Business Picture in 3D detail.

The innovative Predictive Algorithms daily rerun and Machine Learning extend the historical mined Data Relations patterns to the Future, restructuring a precise Future Picture and guiding safe Ordering and Replenishment processes to Maximize Business Profitability and ROI.
","ENTELECHY CUBE creates the AVATAR of any commercial organization System as a hot-air balloon. Profitability gains uplift the balloon, while losses drop the balloon down.

Simulates every passing-by SKU Element and the Business System as the Cube Carriage basket, organizing their Static and Dynamic properties to six specific Category groupings, one per Cube's face. Simulating Blockchain technology creates the CubeChain, a private data library with the linked immutable Day-Cubes, set in chronological order, the EnteleCubes. 

Form a Trusted and Transparent to all Stakeholders, CubeChain of Traceable Information, Inventory, and Financial data in immutable EnteleCubes data.
Each EnteleCube contains the  Open-Day Stock data, SKUs Input and Outputs, the allocated Expenses to the day, and the End-Day Stock data equaled the Next day's Open-Day Stock data.

Using Data mining and Machine Learning restructures a clear Future business picture, utilizes data relations pattern findings into targeted ordering and replenishment processes, achieving the merchandising flows in Equilibrium and compliance with the six faces' trend relations in time.

Allocates the daily expenses per SKU-Cube succeeds in calculating the accurate P&L per SKU and the exact cost per SKU in Stock. Highlights the Profit and Loss-making SKUs and Categories, guiding successful corrective actions.

Finally, it triggers AI by ordering, allocating, relocating, and altering SKU routes in the supply chain to maximize ROI.","ENTELECHY CUBE Innovation stems from tracing each SKU individually along its Supply Chain journey within the Organization. All relevant dimensions (direct/indirect costs, revenues, profit, and losses) are traced to provide a multidimensional image of the Company. This simulates a Business Entity as a hot-air Balloon and its Carriage as a Cube. Inputs of Raw Materials and Products SKU Cubes add the weight of the Supplier Cost, while rents, salaries, and Operating Expenses add the Operating cost weight to the Carriage. Sales converted to Revenues finalize the Business Scope. Profits uplift, and losses force down the Business Balloon.

Using Blockchain logic, ENTELECHY CUBE brings routing information, Inventory, and Financial transactions in connected, transparent, and traceable Day-Cubes. Calculating and allocating all daily Expenses to the participating SKU measures the accurate P&L per sold SKU and the exact cost added per Stocked SKU. Marks the Profitable and Loss-making SKU-Cubes and Categories and the cause of their Results, tracing their ""cost added"" weight through the Supply Chain Routes and instructs focused corrective actions.

Using the historical Static and Dynamic Properties, get accurate Predictive Analytics of the Business, per SKU Cube side:
1. Revenues.
2. Kind.
3. Price.
4. Life Cycle.
5. Source.
6. Costs.

Machine Learning extends Relations pattern findings to the Predicted Future, and AI redirects SKUs to maintain Equilibrium in all six dimensions.

Along with the platform, an omnichannel Service Desk and community engagement platform, driven by our trust on the human-factor, is positioning Eummena’s experts in an effective manner next to the key actors, empowering them in their digital transformation journey, while co-creating value for Customers and Eummena on the way! 
The EdTech Platform is Open by design, built with mature open source software, powerful APIs, open standards and  protocols. Eummena has partnered with major Open EdTech providers and cloud-computing providers to build a scalable and secure platform that targets the full spectrum of education, life-long learning and talent development. Customers can opt to start upfront with a rich Success Plan or buy-as-they-grow in terms of value perception and reception of EdTech. ","We start from Greece and offer our services to the global market. Our EdTech Platform is available in many languages, allowing Eummena to serve our target markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa. EMEA is a significant part of the Global EdTech market that is expected to reach $404 billion by 2025, with a 16.3% annual growth rate. The main drivers of this significant demand are (i) the post Covid-19 response, led by large government investments that will change the means of instruction in schools, Universities and beyond; and (ii) the evolving landscape in corporate learning, where businesses are realizing the need for upskilling their personnel as a driver for cost efficiency and company growth. Our client pool ranges from K-12 to Higher Education institutes, governmental departments and agencies, military, life-long-learning and talent development for the corporate world, in sectors such as healthcare, telecom, energy, banking, food and accommodation, shipping, consultancy houses, and international agencies. Our main channel is marketing with targeted online campaigns and networking through social media, where success stories from our Customers gain track and highlight how they benefit from our VaaS model to co-create value on the EdTech platform. In effect, our key growth enabler is word-of-mouth towards organic growth, as we are already seeing how successful Customers in specific industries and countries lead to similar more knocking on our door.","We operate in the eLearning market, a very mature and saturated one. However, there’s still room for new products and services, as the market is heavily technology-driven and innovation-intensive. What makes Eummena stand out is our focus on the human factor. This originates from our founding principles and is backed by the scientific studies on the significance of empowering the key actors over providing more tools and services, hoping that they may disrupt the way people have been learning and teaching over the centuries. With our compass bolted  on the human factor, we have built an innovative “Value-as-a-Service” (VaaS) model for offering our state-of-the-art EdTech Platform. What our Customers buy from Eummena is not the access to a scalable, intuitive platform for creating rich learning experiences and managing their educational processes. It’s a holistic experience of reaping benefits of  EdTech, being well-supported and coached all the way through, with omnipresent service channels, a community engagement platform and powerful knowledge sharing tools. Customers are paying only for the value they receive and Eummena is striving to maximize this value, in a meaningful and measurable way. Our main drivers of innovation being our Customers, they become our competitive advantage through a value co-creation loop: we reap every opportunity to hear from the field of play, to understand what works best for specific cases and pass this value to more similar cases and Customers.","Eummena’s Open EdTechVaaS  is an experience-first solution, so despite the fact that technology is the vehicle for offering it, we put the emphasis on the human touch. Hence, we consider a major achievement the fact that we have built a strong multilingual team backed by well-documented processes and powerful tools. Our core team is based in Greece and we are succeeding in growing by attracting talent from all over the world. In terms of business goals, a milestone was when we succeeded in entering the Saudi and Emirati markets, two of the most high-potential of the MENA region. Another milestone was building partnerships with companies that offer open EdTech products, such as Moodle, Intelliboard, Turnitin, Smowl, BlindSideNetworks and more. Last, but not least, we are already experiencing organic growth with minimum direct marketing effort: the celebration of our customers on their successes with EdTech on social media gains us traction and leads beyond our direct reach.","Eummena has the typical structure of a startup where the roles and responsibilities can overlap with people covering more than one role. In our core, we have the technical force, led by our Chief Technologist Dr. Tasos Koutoumanos. The team consists of an agile DevOps team and a Service Desk team, with front-end and back-end developers, a UI/UX Expert, SysSecOos and Quality Assurance engineers. In sales, we have our Business Development Manager, Dr. Nikos Palavitsinis, who is serving as our interface with our clients and also serves as the Product Experience Manager, working closely with our clients to make sure we are delivering the value with the proper quality to them. Our business management and steering is led by  Dr. Jad Najjar, the Managing Director, who with the help of a small HR, accounting and marketing team, is also responsible for the overall success and the day to day operations of Eummena. While we enjoy working in our newly established offices in Piraeus' center, we are operating in a fully distributed mode, both in terms of client reach as well as for the way we work, making best use of tools for online teamwork, collaboration over version controlled code, agile roadmapping and issue tracking tools.","Our team has been steadily growing for the past year and a half, although we have operated for the biggest part of this time inside the challenging environment of the pandemic. We have been onboarding more and more clients from Europe and the MENA region, especially from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in both of which the competition is intense and although many established and bigger companies are offering solutions, we have been more than capable to compete with them. 
So far, our numbers show a 15% growth rate in terms of revenue per year. Our aim is to reach 25% in a 2-year span and our goal is to double our team in an horizon of 5 years. What could be perceived as a barrier for our growth, would be our ability to grow internally as a team to foster the exponential growth of our business. We leverage this by an investment in powerful tools including AI-driven chatbots and self-service support, well-documented procedures, targeted training, knowledge management, collaboration tools, and a moderated community of practitioners who exchange success stories and best practices. Another challenge is to streamline our Business Development processes to serve an increasing number of clients, arriving through different channels and market segments. We address this by productizing all our offerings, starting with the Success Plans and moving to the catalogue of value-added services, all available for purchase on an intuitive e-shop, integrated in our Service Desk.","[{'title': 'MINISTRY OF DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENTS', 'amount': 'EUR 100K', 'year': '2022', 'type': 'Seed, Grant'}]",,,,Bootstrapped,NA

Via the introduction of variable pricing mechanism, the app encourages drivers (via lower cost) to charge their electric vehicles during time intervals of surplus renewable energy capacity or low demand in the energy grid. During stress intervals for the grid, charging will be discouraged through the pricing mechanisms.","EV Loader is a cloud and mobile app solution featuring two modules:

Module 1: Charging Station back-office
Charging Station Owners can list their stations in Loader app in order to increase the frequency of charges at their stations, offer a streamlined payment system for drivers and keep track of the transactions that occur in their charging station, through a web and a mobile app. The app also pushes availability and price data for charging stations of the network to open data repositories. These data are then accessible by other app operators, meaning that charging stations directly managed by Loader app can be visible and operational via other applications. This leads to additional revenue to both charging station owners and Loader app, through charging session initiated by third party apps (roaming). 

Module 2: Driver application
User of EVs can view and book multiple charging stations in different locations and businesses (hotels, parking businesses, retail shops) and benefit from variable pricing incentives by charging at time intervals with surplus of renewable energy capacity in the grid.
","The volume of EV charging transactions is expected to surpass €1.5 bn by 2024 and we aim to capture a significant share of this market. There are no consolidated players in this market currently which presents opportunities for first movers that earn preference for EV drivers. EV Loader is based on Open Charge Point Protocol and is compatible with most of available charging stations in global market.  EV drivers and station owners enjoy EV Loader features, that are not available from competitors. Such characteristics are 1) the use of blockchain technology for the data exchanges and control among the station, the EV driver, and the car itself, 2) integration of predictive models to forecast station occupancy and modify pricing accordingly and 3) the incentivization of EV drivers to charge their cars at times when there is a surplus of green energy capacity in the grid","EV Loader launched during October 2020 in Greece.

We are using state of the art AutoML to discovery novel Biomarkers for diseases, like diabetes, using an innovative minimally invasive method called Liquid Biopsy. ","ABCureD P.C. offers a laboratory test for pancreatic cell loss monitoring in Diabetes. The solution we propose is based on an innovative minimally invasive method for the diagnosis of prediabetes and the prediction and monitoring of T2DM.
The ABCureD research team has developed a method that shows high sensitivity and accuracy in detecting pathological manifestations of T2DM – the highest reported in the literature (proof-of-concept). We focus on circulating DNA (ccfDNA), a liquid biopsy biomaterial that reflects epi/genetic features of a pathological tissue. Specifically, the method uses a machine learning model, incorporating pancreatic β-cell gene methylation patterns and selected patient demographic data. The test is performed on a blood sample and implemented in the laboratory with a technique based on PCR and accompanied by a smart easy-to-use application. The treating physician is informed with a score that reflects the extent of pancreatic damage (currently not possible with any other test), based on which he will make informed decisions about individualized management, as well as patient awareness.
","Our invention combines three unique innovative elements for the first time in the field of diagnosis of prediabetes and the prediction and monitoring of T2DM, namely liquid biopsy, methylation biomarkers, automated machine learning (autoML). The autoML predictive model built based on our laboratory results demonstrates the highest  performance than any other previously reported or used generally in diabetes entities (AUC of 0.927 (95%CI 0.874 - 0.967) discriminating T2DM from health and average Precision of 0.951 (95% CI 0.914 - 0.980). The superiority of our model relies on: a. the autoML feature selection of a combination rather that a single methylation biomarker, b. the use of liquid biopsy mirroring the pancreas, c. the combination of epigenetic with other patient features.","An EPO/WIPO patent application has been filed and is currently under consideration, entitled “Method for monitoring pancreatic beta-cell destruction in disease prediction/diagnosis/prognosis of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus’ (EP21386030, PCT/EP2022/000048 filing date 20/5/2022).

Standard analytical methods rely on multi-step sample preparation procedures that use and/or generate large amounts of hazardous solvents. Microextraction is a solventless alternative that allows extraction of trace amounts of chemicals from samples. For complex samples (such as food), microextraction sampling proceeds from the headspace above the sample. In this setup, long sampling times are needed to ensure that chemicals reach the microextraction device. Heating the sample can partially overcome this problem but may result in loss in sensitivity, sample decomposition and the creation of other components or artifacts. The problem in headspace microextraction sampling is a major bottleneck in laboratories dealing with food, flavour, beverages, biological and environmental applications.","Our products/methods offer headspace microextraction under vacuum as an alternative to heating. Vacuum greatly speeds up extraction and ensures high sample throughput, lowering analysis costs. Under vacuum, superior analytical performance is achieved even at cool temperatures, protecting the character of samples. Our patent pending methods are automated, green, low cost, energy efficient and compatible to a range of microextraction devices. So far, the obstacle for spreading headspace microextraction under vacuum was the lack of gastight commercial samplers. Our patent pending products consist of stoppers that fit to commercial vials and guarantee constant vacuum conditions. We are concluding our alpha/beta version testing for our initial products and in 2021 we are marketing our first range of laboratory products. Our starter kit will contain our patented stoppers, septa, vials and detailed Instructions for our methods. Protocols may be developed specifically for customers/projects.","Under the new global conditions with Covid-19, we adopted a new business approach where we are in charge of production and request distribution and advertising from our key players collaborators. Our growth potential relies on the large network of customers these multinational companies have. The increased needs in monitoring and compliance of chemicals resulted in an exponential increase in samples to analyse and our product/methods address this challenge without entailing a large financial investment by customers. An important market to expand is China largely due to the size and intensification of analytical activities. A barrier for growth potential in this country may be the administrative structure. Our company has established long-term collaborations with Chinese research groups, and the multinational companies we collaborate have strong sub-branches in China that can reach academic and non-academic laboratories. On the other hand, markets in Europe and USA have immense growth potential as the microextraction methods our product empowers are widespread. Scalabilty from our end depends on securing funding for further financing our IP strategy, working capital and hiring more staff. We will need to employ young scientists to assist in developing new patents and applications. In the long-term funding in manufacturing equipment will minimize our current need for outsourcing  production of our products.","Our products are related to a mature scientific approach ready to be commercialized. We have published and presented applications related to food, beverages and environmental sectors.

The only way to remove the cataract and/or perform RLE is through surgical replacement of the human natural crystalline lens by an artificial IntraOcular lens (IOL) implant. Despite the explosion of innovations designed to optimise the visual outcome of the procedure, several postoperative complications may occur related to the fibrotic reaction and collapse of the human lens capsule. In some cases, a tilt can occur while placing the IOL or the IOL may end up in a slightly different depth within the eye than the pre-operative prediction. In other cases, post cataract opacification (PCO) behind the IOL may develop. Both cases lead to deterioration of visual function and may require secondary treatment and/or eventually the use of glasses and/or contact lenses to obtain “glasses free” visual performance.
","fixOflex is a novel intraocular ophthalmic implant that was developed to “reconstruct” and hold the human lens capsule similar to its natural form during surgical replacement of the human lens and address post-operative complications. Moreover, it is a placeholder for any IOL and acts as complementary to IOL implantation providing a beneficial optical outcome to the surgery. fixOflex combines low-cost manufacturing, easiness to use, safety and minimal training for surgeons, giving Ophthalmologists’ the opportunity to achieve optimal satisfaction for cataract and RLE patients. fixOflex aims to more personalized care, tailored specifically to every single patient’s needs for improvement to achieve optimal satisfaction.
","A novel approach in the lens removal surgeries has been long anticipated to tackle successfully the aforementioned problems. The product's innovation relies on its benefits which are a) circumferential barrier against cell migration and development of PCO, b) consistent “bed” for IOL placement, c) secure IOL replacement at any time, d) partial prevention of forward movement of vitreous, e) universal design, that can be used with most IOLs , and f) preservation of capsular bag form and enclosed volume resembling the normal lens.
The company has already developed a network of partners in Egypt, Greece, Germany, Austria and Spain. In the scale up phase, expansion to other countries and adjacent market is planned. The scale up strategy is twofold:
a) Industrialization phase, improve production and manufacturing to reduce defects, and cost per unit. Reduction of costs and defects will be one of the main concerns as the company will design the third generation of fixOflex that will carry significant enhancements to the second generation. The company will acquire its own equipment and develop its own production facilities to manufacture the device.
b) Expanding to geographical markets, gradually (depending on strategic objectives and operational conditions to exploit economies of scale. The operations of the company will expand to selected geographical markets according to market and economic conditions.

The company was founded to become a point of excellence in wireless communications research and innovation, and eventually bridge research with product development and service provision. In FERON TECHNOLOGIES we are:
- Developing innovative telecom protocols, products, and services
- Integrating solutions and applications for todays and tomorrow’s networks
- Enabling ICT in various verticals, such as transportation, agriculture, industry, logistics
- Consulting third party companies on all-things related to establishing and maintaining an ad-hoc network infrastructure
- Boosting innovation through collaborative projects, such as Horizon 2020, Connected Europe Facility, Future Internet Research Experimentation, ESPA and Β2Β Partnerships
Our primary focus is on Emergency Response Networks and Solutions, where we capitalize on all the know-how, technologies and prototypes we have worked on during the last 5 years.","In the strike of an emergency event in a restricted area with a complex structure, such as when extinguishing fires in underground facilities/tunnels, or when evacuating buildings, specialized personnel and robotic equipment are usually deployed. Coordinating remote resources requires a reliable telecom backbone. Conventional technologies and public communication networks are not able to optimally support rich communications -including data and video feed- in such scenarios.
In FERON TECHNOLOGIES we aim at disrupting the emergency communications landscape with “AMESON”, a new hardware and software solution for deploying, operating and managing an on-demand and fully-automated telecom network. This network will assist/support/control/interact with people (S&R personnel), robots (surface, underwater or aerial vehicles) and things (cameras, sensors, actuators). AMESON enhances situational awareness to first responders and emergency units offering new operational capabilities in search-and-rescue missions. The proposed solution (currently at TRL6-7) has been designed on the grounds of sound in-house and 3rd party technologies, extending the current state-of-the-art for communication networks and IoT, and taking into account critical business development factors.  It relies on the concepts of embedded hardware, open-software, globally standardized connectivity technologies, avoiding vendor/hardware lock-in, instead being a highly modular, scalable and customizable solution.","Today’s mobile networks coverage in deep-indoor/subterranean environments is usually weak or completely lost, while the WiFi range is limited to a few tens of meters. Legacy mobile networks have repeatedly failed to deliver during a localized crisis event, since they can’t cope with the increased impulse demand. Therefore, relying on existing and/or publicly available telecommunication infrastructure is considered a no-go today for mission critical conditions where lives could be at stake. The AMESON solution uniquely integrates technologies for addressing the key challenges of emergency communications systems. In particular, it can maintain sufficient communication in a complex structure, transmit different type of data (sensor, video), enable remote control of assisting robots, support enhanced range, adapt to region-specific wireless  transmission rules, work under extreme conditions (steam, high-temperature, water-jets), and provide zero-touch configuration, with a system cost of a few thousands of euro only. For the past decades critical communications have been defined by digital land mobile radio technologies (TETRA, P25, DMR) and in the last few years by 4G-5G (FirstNet).  AMESON differs from these approaches as it relies on low-cost relay nodes using unlicensed wireless technologies that can be easily deployed on-demand and extend indoor coverage to complex structures. And most importantly it uses open technologies revolutionizing the traditional closed approach.","In 2015, FERON was established as legal entity and participated in THEA City of Athens Business Incubator. In 2016 FERON joined the Corallia mi-cluster, and was awarded the first EU-funded project (more than 10 projects and 700k funding has been acquired so far), which supported the development and release of its first products. In mid-2018 the company completed its first Software-Defined-Radio protocol stack for 3GPP D2D and V2X technologies, which was among the first of their kind implementations. 
In 2018 the company started working on the emergency communications sector, and by Q1-19 developed a solution for unmanned sea vehicles interconnectivity, which was demonstrated in the Hellenic Naval Base of Skaramagkas, in Greece. In 2020, the company joined the EU project ESMERA and gained seed funding for developing the first AMESON PoC, in close collaboration with the CEA-LETI Centre and BSPP (Paris Fire-Brigade). In 2021, FERON completed and demonstrated its first PoC in real-world conditions.","The founders team consisted of technology and business development experts, with collectively more than 60 years of experience. The core team brings together different and complementary backgrounds, synthesizing a set of diverse competences, skills and expertise, including: 
•Technology development, including DSP design, antenna systems and simulation and prototyping of radio technology standards in SDR platforms;

Currently, ACCELIGENCE Ltd. is building its own UAV, which can carry more than 15 KGs and several sensors. It will provide the space for building embedded intelligence thanks to additional GPUs.
","Despite the increasing capabilities of autonomous agents, their functionality is focused on specific applications, while their autonomy and interoperability with humans and platforms are limited. Moreover, the lack of gathering scene intelligence, threat diagnosis and forecasting, and other advanced capabilities creates a gap in civil applications. Autonomous surveillance systems can assist in complex and heterogeneous environments, providing cost-effective solutions while maintaining a high level of situational awareness. Our main product will provide early and robust target identification and tracking, pollution incident alerts, prediction of incidents and illegal communication detection, requiring minimal infrastructure and management effort. Our proposed UAV solution DIOPTRA (- a game changer for autonomous surveillance and event prediction that will render competing technologies obsolete by leveraging existing UAV infrastructure) will be a next-generation drone able to lift to 15 kg of payload. Due to its optimised design will have an extended flight time of up to 30 minutes, which is a substantial advantage compared to conventional models currently available in the market, and a high precision localisation of 1cm using GPS-RTK2. DIOPTRA will be one of the first commercially available UAVs equipped with a separate onboard computer with a GPU. This configuration will be ideal for running complex AI algorithms, which makes DIOPTRA the ideal drone for complex tasks.
","DIOPTRA will enable the execution of tasks that cut across different application domains of high societal and economic impact, including missions ranging from crime-fighting, early identification and tracking of illegal activities to commercial activities, by performing inspection and maintenance activities with the help of the remote command and control capabilities. DIOPTRA will utilize an innovative UAV and provide a holistic surveillance and incident identification framework with robust and enhanced command and control tools to yield advanced coordinated navigation while preserving communication with the control centre. The DIOPTRA system actions and reactions will be governed by autonomous control functionalities making adaptable decisions on task execution, and path planning in order to deal, where applicable, with extreme operational environments. Finally, the system will be capable of managing and intelligently combining the massive data gathered during operation so as to continuously improve its perception and cognition abilities, whilst also providing human operators the means to store, process and analyse this data; thus enabling the efficient off-line planning, and on-line and real-time remote monitoring and control of the overall operation process.","High Tech Startup Founded in 2019 in Cyprus Headquarters located in Nicosia Center Specializes in UAV and Robotic platform manufacturing and R&D Services in various sectors, including security sector (IoT, Smart camera, other security services) Founder with experience in the delivery of 30+ projects (consulting + technical, public + private) Current Involvement in (on-going) EU Projects: H2020 SU-BES02-2019-ISOLA: Onboard Security of passenger ships Η2020 INFRA-01 – 2019 – 7 SHIELD: Protection of Ground Space Infrastructures H2020 SPACE-2019-CALLISTO: Copernicus artificial intelligence services H2020 LCCI-2020-EASME-singlestage - AQUASPICE: Digital and Circular Water Innovative Services  H2020 MSCA-RISE-2019 – RECOMBINE: 5G future networks Solutions: SAITA UAV (https://accelligence.tech/solutions/) Smart Farming Systems Smart Medical IoT Components","The core team of ACCELIGENCE Ltd. has been involved in dozens of Research and Implementation projects for more than 20 years in Research, Development and Innovation: Project & Scientific Coordination of Consortia for more than 15 years.

This is particularly relevant to highly sophisticated techniques, such as IVF. 

Fertilai aims to leverage the power of machine learning in order to fight infertility and improve womens' health all around the globe. 

Fertilai vision emphasizes the democratization of AI for IVF specialists & patients. More specifically, it empowers fertility specialists to generate machine learning models in a guardrail-safe manner that embeds standard data science best practices. For the first time ever, there is no need for clinics to depend on external partners & data scientists for creating ML models and solutions.","Fertilai is the first AutoML platform built for IVF specialists and patients. The unique characteristics of Fertilai enable the creation of high-quality custom machine learning models without spending lots of resources. Moreover, Fertilai adopts a privacy-by-design approach that focuses on proactively embedding privacy into the architecture of all system components.

The system usage involves the following three steps: 
(A) Train: feed data, such as a set of photos or videos, in order to train a new machine learning (ML) model.
(B) Fine-tune: configure a few ML model parameters, based on the unique characteristics of each clinic/specialist, in order to boost its performance.
(C) Predict: deploy the created ML model in order to receive real-time predictions.

Fertil.ai IVF products include web and mobile apps that are able to analyse and rank embryos based on their pregnancy chances, select donors based on their facial similarity, or even assess endometrial receptivity before transfer.

The first phase of clinical trials has already been completed. A blinded clinical trial, conducted in one of the leading IVF clinics in Europe, has demonstrated that Fertilai AutoML solution can be both effective and efficient. A series of user-configured ML models have achieved an accuracy that exceeded 90%.","As the world becomes increasingly reliant on AI, it is not surprising that fertility clinics have embraced the AI age with enthusiasm. It is anticipated that AI-powered solutions will help infertility specialists and embryologists become more objective, more accurate, and more rapid, resulting in greater precision, standardization, and automatization in the field of IVF. Some emerging applications of AI technologies that have proven to be really useful focus on the ability to identify and select the ‘‘best’’ embryo for transfer. 

Given that the main barrier to achieving mass adoption seems to be the increased cost introduced by requiring additional lab hardware and the inability to customize such tools based on the individual needs and performance of each IVF clinic, this is where Fertilai comes into play, offering a customizable AutoML platform that can be configured and used by any IVF unit.","- Utilizing thousands of photos of human embryos, Fertilai has successfully trained its initial ML model that accurately predicts embryos potential of achieving pregnancy with an accuracy that exceeds 90%
- Fertilai has created a proprietary AutoML engine that allows ML models to be configured automatically based on the unique characteristics, hardware, and historical data of each clinic
- Fertilai has successfully built its MVP; a web-based computer vision platform that assists embryologists in their daily embryo selection process
- Fertilai was awarded in the NextStage 2021 startup competition 
- Fertilai has successfully completed its first clinical trial, which took place in a real world environment and included junior and senior embryologists from an IVF unit.

","We developed a product that helps customers to easily establish healthy eating habits. - a ready-to-eat personalized meal delivery service. The future is to turn this into a tech-focused, hyper-personalized meal experience, where plans are being modified to suit one's needs, nutritional preferences, and tastes based on behavioral data. 
To sum up, through software development, we developed a custom cloud-based pos-management - automation system that not only collects, translates, and enriches data records, but also runs our business smoothly and automates as many business and IT processes as possible, e.g., we implemented waste control to increase our cost controls and maximize profitability.

The opportunity lies in using technology and web 3.0 tools, needed to deliver high-quality, hyper-personalized meal plans for a ready-to-eat meal delivery service, based on nutritional science. In addition, software development can reduce food waste as information like ingredients and portions can be precisely measured. 
Finally, as we collect data to develop credible software, our opportunity lies in licensing it to enterprises that will use it in their own data centers and cloud environments.

We started small and we are now working our way up the CX techniques pyramid, hence we are working on implementing advanced AI and algorithms in the new website and mobile app that we are developing for a better UI/UX/CX (user interface/user experience/customer experience). These AI and algorithms will also create messages, promotions, and advertisements that are user based, leading to improved conversion rates and an improved customer experience.

Our production rate has kept growing: 10K meals per month (MPM) in April 2021, 16K MPM in September 2021, and 22K MPM in May 2022.  

In 2022, we became the first Greek company in the food sector with a recurring payment service. 
To sum up, in 2020 we had Revenue of €70K and now we are on track for €1,5MM in 2022 (only in Athens). We estimate to double our revenue next year in Greece alone.

The FOGUS MC includes: the client-side mobile app and the support system (i.e., the Application Server and a set of Management Servers). 
The major advantages of the FOGUS solution are: i) it enables public safety communications through conventional mobile phones ii) it expands the critical communication potential to video and data sharing services.
","FOGUS primary activity relates to Research and Innovation (FOGUS is member of EU Research and Innovation consortia and associations (e.g., 5GPPP https://5g-ppp.eu/, Network Europe https://www.networldeurope.eu/) and aims at a commercial exploitation of its public safety and critical communication solution. In this context, FOGUS has managed so far to fulfill three main innovation shaping requirements, namely, 
i)tProduction and use of results from R&D activities. The company has provided vast contribution to the production of innovative research results that is now ready to exploit them through commercial products. 
ii)tCombination of existing state-of-the-art technologies. FOGUS adopts cutting-edge development features to produce the FOGUS MC solution (continuous integration and continuous delivery- CI/CD, cloud services etc.). For instance, the server-side components are designed as NFV components, fostering agile and flexible deployments towards 5G.
iii)tDevelopment of a new business model. FOGUS is one of the few SMEs that enters the emerging market of mission critical communication through mobile networks. The adopted technology encompasses the most recent features standardised by 3GPP.

","FOGUS is a young company (founded in 2016) that thrives fast. A stable financial growth is observed so far with key achievements/milestones:
-tContinuous participation in big consortia composed of leading companies and research centers in the field of wireless communication (starting from June 2018). 
-tMembership in EU associations and SDOs (5GPPP TB, ETSI) 
-tCo-authoring of position papers released by 5G Infrastructure Association.
Based on the background achieved so far, and especially the expertise on related technology standards, the company schedules to launch in the marker a complete and solid mission critical solution, starting with the FOGUS MC App and cloud instances of the FOGUS MC service suite. 
","The growth potential of FOGUS is coupled with the scaling-out trend that is now observed to similar companies in Europe. More precisely, the following aspects contribute to a stable growth of FOGUS in the coming years.
-tThe company encompasses both the telecom/ICT sector and the public safety domain. This is a key advantage (and a necessary asset) for providing MC services.
-tThe business/financial figures for the SMEs in the ICT sector are quite encouraging. The added value of SMEs in the ICT sector in EU is currently around 75%, while the SME employment is growing faster than the overall employment the recent years. 
It is also clear, that a slow realization pace of the paradigm shift from conventional public safety communication to advanced MC services is a factor that might slow the penetration of the FOGUS product in the market. This might affect the growth of the company, as well. However, 5G mobile networks are evolving and they are expected to support Mission critical communications in the next years. More precisely, starting from 2020, and progressively till 2024, there will be the possibility for a mission critical network with full standalone 5G functionality using only the 5G radio interface.
","The minimum funding needs are estimated at around 200K Euro/year that could efficiently cover the following categories of costs:

Exclusively for robotic applications, servo motors are used exclusively for high-precision driving over a wide range of speeds. Faults in electric motors can be divided into two main categories, electrical faults and mechanical faults. Our application will target the second category of failures, mechanical which are more usual. The nature of these failures is such that they are usually caused when the electric motor is called to operate at max capacity, ie during intense production process. This fault will bring the machine into emergency stop and if this machine is part of a larger production line it may halt the entire line. The cost of repair is usually quite high because such damages may even cause the complete destruction of the electric motor long before the end of its estimated lifespan. But even worse, the high recovery time results in a disproportionate loss of revenue.","Our company comes to tackle the above-mentioned problems with the predictive maintenance FourSector software. This software is empowered by all the necessary parameters that we have selected and we know their effect on the measurements of vibrations, such as for example the make and type of machine, the production date, the type of electric motor, the type of drive, the, the weight of the load etc. The software generates an identification number (MCID) for each electric motor according to the given parameterization. By feeding this number and the measurements to the web application that we will develop, we will compare and match the results of other electric motors compatible with the one to be examined. This mathematical comparison will be based on three-dimensional tables, which result from measurements with two-dimensional vibration measurements. All software will run on an online server using PHP-MySQL-JavaScript-HTML technologies and Cloud technology for its implementation. ","Large companies abroad engaged in the preventive maintenance of electric motors have developed instruments for measuring vibrations with accelerometers (one and two axis). These instruments generate a series of waveforms that describe the vibrations of the rotor during its rotation. The analysis of these waveforms can give us an idea of the vibrations received or caused by the rotor during the operation. However, as the same companies explicitly explain in the documentation of these instruments, the measurements alone cannot produce a definitive result regarding the condition of the entire mechanical device or the electric motor. In addition and in order to create the history, there must be a recording of measurements of the motor from the beginning of its operation. Therefore, all machines that are over 8-10 years old in the production process are automatically excluded.  Second, to create the history there should initially be regular checks at short intervals, about once or twice a month for each motor. Since a machine can have several electric motors and each factory usually has more than one machine up to a few dozen machines, regular checking and recording would require each factory to have both the equipment and the qualified personnel to do so. ","Four Sectors has met some crucial milestones both in business and in product development. Four Sectors has already come into an agreement with Vestal Skoumpourdis and Dimopoulos SHOPS to apply our software on the CNC machines of these two.

Fraud experts claim an average annual loss of 5% of revenues with a median incident cost of 150.000 dollars, which in the vast majority companies do not recover. Furthermore, other legal and ethical violations, such as harassment, health and safety issues, environmental problems, breaches of confidentiality and personal data, damage the corporate culture and brand name while companies are exposed to serious legal risks (penalties and legal claims). 
Employees know better than any external auditor, what goes wrong inside the organization. In fact tips (whistleblowing) expose most of the illegal and unethical cases. Although the risks and consequences are serious, most of the companies have not yet implemented whistleblowing systems.
However, the European Directive 1937/2019, which must be incorporated into the national legislation by the end of 2021, obliges companies with more than 50 employees to implement reporting channels and to protect whistleblowers. Furthermore, nowadays public opinion seems to change in favour of whistleblowers while whistleblowing is promoted as a good corporate practice to combat illegal activities.  So the landscape is changing for whistleblowing, which soon will be a “must have” for companies.","Fraud Line is offering a complete, cost - effective set of whistleblowing services: 
- An online, 24/7, secure, mobile and pc friendly whistleblowing platform, that assists the employees to report incidents of wrongdoing in the company. The incident administrator keeps touch with the whistleblowers through the case management system, without compromising the anonymity of the whistleblower. 
- Experiential eLearning program on whistleblowing, as communication material to  empower employees and foster a culture of corporate integrity. The training contains interactive material and quizzes. It gives clear guidance to trainees on how, when and why to make a report and it decomposes obsolete beliefs about whistleblower as a snits.
- Customized whistleblowing policy helps the organization prevent misconduct or stop it as early as possible minimizing losses. The policy describes the framework of whistleblowers` protection and the management of the reports. Policies regarding the investigation of the reports, the management of the rights of data subjects and data privacy impact assessment are also necessary and we provide it, when our client fills a structured questionnaire.
","Fraud Line has the opportunity to disrupt the whistleblowing services market through its holistic approach. We are offering a competitive and unique, all in one, complete whistleblowing SaaS including whistleblowing platform, e-training material and a customised policy, making whistleblowing accessible for all companies and organisations, independent of size. 
The innovative whistleblowing platform combines a tool for the submission of reports with a case management system for reports. It also combines anonymity with an open channel of communication between the whistleblower and the incident administrator. 
The e-learning training program is combined with the whistleblowing platform. So during the training and when the awareness of the trainees is high, a link of the whistleblowing platform comes up motivating them to report, if something illegal or unethical has come into their attention.
The whistleblowing system is scalable since only a small part of the platform and e-training needs to be customized according to the needs of each company. Through an on-line structured questionnaire, the whistleblowing policy and procedures are easily customized. 
After the incorporation of the European directive into the national legislation of member states, the Global Whistleblowing Software market is expected to see growth rate of 3.74% and may see market size of USD313.0 Million by 2025, according to Advance Market Analytics. ","Between mid 2019- 2020 we won  contracts with market leaders such as Stoiximan, Ellaktor Group, Lamda Development and Attikes Diadromes offering services to 130 legal bodies and 10.000 employees in Germany, France, Kuwait, Bulgaria, Romania, Austria, Malta, Portugal Colombia, Cyprus and Greece.

We cooperate with Universities, businesses, research teams and individuals in the development of our technology so to expand the out-rearch and effect of our innovation. 
We never cease to research for supplementary or new technologies aiming to the improvement of the whole food production-consumption chain for the benefit of all key stakeholder involved.
","Our solution addresses the problem of limitation in the fresh fish sources. Free sea fishing has reached the maximum production capacity during the last few decades and aquaculture tends to be the solution to fulfill the global fish demand while inadequate processing, improper handling and hygiene results in discarding a significant part of fish production. 
The solution we offer is a post harvest technology to prolong the shelf-life of fish (ie Computer Vision System, UV-C radiation, Y-aminobutyric Acid and Active Modified Atmosphere Packaging), which extends the shelf-life of fish by 3-4 times than conventional method. The production line we offer is a fully automated process, supported by AI, cameras, and other technological innovations with which we can achieve a high production rate with minimum production residuals. 
This process 
1. Decreases food waste due to the shelf-life extension, thus increase the EU’s self-sufficiency
2. Offers a solution to the decrease of the aquaculture production shrinking quantity, since it will “multiply” the existing capacity by prolonging fish shelf life
3. Enhances production efficiencies thus minimize production wastes resulting from existing inefficient process and low standards of hygiene
","Our innovation is a Post-harvest technology applied to fresh fish that 
(i) Maintains the sensory quality: taste, firmness, color and odor
(ii) Nutritional quality of fish: Crude Protein, Lipids, Fatty acid
(iii) And increases the shelf-life by 3-4 times compared to existing technologies
The confirmed test results are the following: 
(i) Successfully extending the shelf-life of seabream up to 40 days.
(ii) Successfully extending the shelf-life of seabass up to 30 days.
(iii) Successfully extending the shelf-life of shrimps up to 21 days.

Relevant percentages of increase noticed in the majority of European countries (ecommerce Europe, 2020). The increase of ecommerce leads also to increase of the needs in digital presence and digital content. Video usage in social media has been continuously increasing. The next generation of social networks (like TikTok) is only video-enabled. As a result, Marketing & Advertising on social media is moving forward to the video era.
At the same time, Marketing & Advertising within the e-commerce world has not progressed/evolved accordingly. The dominant type of posts/ads is static images. In internal research that we conducted in 2019, we collected 20.000 Facebook posts from 150 companies pages in Greece (from all sectors), and the results showed that 86% of the posts consist of static images (Gaming Brotherhood, 2019).
Due to the fact that video creation (to promote products) is a time-consuming and expensive procedure only large e-shops (the elite of e-commerce companies) with big budgets tend to invest in this type of communication The majority of e-shops still use only static images.

For the past 3 years, we have been focused almost exclusively on the design and manufacture of an innovative Internal Combustion Engine, based on our patented design, that allows us to control the kinematic motion of the piston and hence, create a cleaner, more efficient, and more powerful combustion.

More info about our LESS innovative technology can be found on its own website, https://less-engineering.com/","Our basic innovation lies in our patented mechanism for converting reciprocating motion to rotary motion and vice versa. This is called the LESS mechanism, and itself has many applications, from Pumps, to Compressors, to Internal Combustion Engines. We've already built a prototype for a compressor using our patented design, and we are currently building a pump and an internal combustion engine.

Right now, we are focusing on our 2-cylinder, 4-stroke, 413cc petrol engine prototype, which will be completed, tested an evaluated soon.","Internal Combustion Engines in particular have a lot of disadvantages and flaws, but they are still wonders of engineering, and they get the job done. With LESS, all of the proven technologies and solutions are kept in place, and we merely improve a key component that allows us to do the same job, only better. With a lighter and smaller mechanism.

Since it doesn’t affect the thermodynamic cycles of traditional engines, the LESS mechanism is applicable to all kinds of ICEs (Diesel, Gasoline, LPGs etc). Even better, we can improve them! With LESS, the combustion can be designed specifically as wanted, resulting in increased performance and efficiency.

For example, we can introduce a delay in the Top and Bottom Dead Centers of the piston (via the undulated surfaces’ design, see Kinematics section for more info), and fix a shortcoming of the crankshaft mechanism resulting in high energy losses and low-efficiency ratio due to the imperfect combustion. The delay in the Top Dead Center enables a near-perfect isochoric combustion and better mechanical conversion of the pressure in the combustion chamber into work.

Because our mechanism makes 2 (or more) reciprocations per full rotation, it completes one full combustion cycle in 360 degrees. As a result of this, we produce the same work as traditional designs at half the RPMs but twice the torque, as you can see on the right, cutting the amount of gear reduction required by half.
","As mentioned, so far we have built 2 prototypes, one as a pump, and one as a compressor, to verify the basic components of our mechanism. We have also designed our first petrol engine prototype, which will be our first near-market-ready and proof-of-concept prototype, showcasing our design's advantages.","The principal innovator behind the patent, George Georgitzikis, has decades of experience as a mechanical engineer, has designed dozens of innovative products, and is the author of two more patents.

Our instruments have been used in hundreds of projects in the most difficult conditions and harsh environments, worldwide, from Papua jungle, and Middle East Desert to Himalayan Mountains and Alaska Icy terrain. We are more than happy that they never had any operational problem or fail. Several thousands of instruments have been deployed worldwide up to now (Oct 2020). ","Our solution is to supply the industry with portable, low power, low cost, geophysical and seismological instruments, such as 32bit ADC seismic digitizers & recorders, broad-band and wide-band seismic sensors and processing software, for exploration geophysics and seismology. Our instruments are ideal for local and regional seismicity and micro-seismicity monitoring and for seismic events such as those induced by unconventional hydrocarbon extraction (e.g. hydraulic fracturing). The instruments we provide are suitable for the oil and Gas industry, for geothermal and geophysical applications and for structural monitoring of buildings, bridges, dams, tunnels, monuments. 
Our recent product, which currently is under development, will bring revolution in the earthquake early warning systems by creating a new tiny accelerometer. This device will be very cheap and easy to install. It will send alerts to a smartphone in order to warn about upcoming earthquakes 30 to 60 sec earlier.

 ","The answer to the problem described above is the Gi-Polis Solution, through which Push Notifications are sent based on the geographical location of the user. All locationing technologies can be used to determine the user's position. The notifications are sent with a locationing accuracy of about 5m. The communication of the user's mobile device with the internet can be realized either through 4g / 5g or via Wi-Fi. The operation of the system is based on sending mobile push notifications through a custom designed application. The user downloads the application via app / play store. The Solution ensures the complete anonymity of the user and is fully harmonized with the terms of the GDPR Directive. The Solution includes the necessary Management Information System and Geographic Information System to send the messages to the end user. The Solution also includes a module for the presentation of the basic statistics for the users who receive the notofications by day, month, year, etc.","The Gi-Polis Solution aims at the direct information of the users, in order to support the scope of the Public and Private Bodies that utilize it.  

The main feature that distinguish Gi-Polis Solution as pioneering and innovative, is the certified anonymity of the user, as our company has ISO 9001: 2015 Certification with subject: Digital information services through geolocation. Another important feature of our solution is the identification of the user's geographical location, using geographical zones and not its actual accurate position. Therefore, these competitive advantages atract more users, at a lower cost per installation, maintenance etc. Our solution remains unique and groundbreaking in the Greek and international market after its first two years of operation.

The scalability of our Solution can be immediate and exponential.  Our solution has the ability to increase its clients widely while the cost of system processing demands remain low. The solution demand may grow rapidly with a proper sales strategy and funding.
","So far and after 2 years of operation, Gi-Polis Solution is used by about 25 Municipalities in Greece and Cyprus. Also, from the end of 2021 Bodies such as the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Attiki Natural gas Distribution Company and Egnatia Motorway SA, will utilize Gi-Polis. 

In the context of the awarding of annual prizes for applications in local government, the Best City Awards 2020, under the auspices of the central Union of Municipalities of Greece, the Municipality of Rafina-Pikermi was honored with the SILVER BEST CITY AWARD 2020 in the field of early warning and informing citizens for civil protection.

Engineers urgently need to design and analyse their projects more efficiently, while industries are continually striving to improve their competitiveness by optimizing their products, reducing time-to-market, and saving financial and natural resources (materials, energy). This industrial problem is directly associated with a major gap between CAD and finite element analysis, which dates to the 1960's. Until now, designers create the product design using CAD software and then deliver it to engineers, who transfer it to a CAE program to carry out its analysis. Thus, engineers are unable to efficiently utilize the existing exact mesh and must create from the very beginning a new one, which is not precise, while geometric errors are introduced and the engineering analysis is not accurate enough to study complex models.","The Geomiso software has come to satisfy the imperative industrial need for dual CAD/CAE software and fill the gap between CAD and finite element analysis. It is the world’s first fully integrated 3D design and isogeometric analysis commercial program, which fully integrates the industrial design of any product with any thickness and curvature with its computational real-time testing. Geomiso enables industries and engineers to more efficiently test, validate and optimize their product's durability and performance and deliver faster more accurate results with no geometric errors. This outcome of 10-year research is not just a plug-in, but a brand-new hybrid software, both stand-alone and 100% cloud-based, for applications on isogeometric analysis and 3D design with the ability of analyzing complex structures, machines, or objects, otherwise incredibly challenging, with a wide spectrum of applications from mechanical, structural, geotechnical engineering to aeronautics and biomechanics.","The Geomiso software is the world’s first «two-in-one» fully integrated 3D design and isogeometric analysis commercial software, which offers an innovative way to merge computer-aided design with computer-aided engineering into a single procedure, thus allowing engineers to simultaneously design and test their products and projects. It has many features in common with both engineering simulation software and design programs. Its innovation stems from the novel isogeometric analysis, the powerful generalization of the classical finite element analysis, and from the fact that it is not just a plug-in, but a new hybrid software, both stand-alone and 100% cloud-based, with a dual CAD/CAE nature and a modern graphical user interface, used to both design products and predict how these product designs will behave in real-world environments, without building test products or conducting crash tests. Geomiso is a more efficient alternative to finite element programs, as it facilitates the geometry modeling within analysis, eliminates geometric errors, offers superior quality numerical results, significantly increases the accuracy, robustness, and stability level in analysis, and drastically reduces the computational cost. In contrast, the finite element programs, not only cannot fully utilize the available data of the CAD model, but also makes engineers unable to benefit from the latest CAD advanced techniques. This is the first time worldwide such a hybrid software has been developed.","Current clients: European construction companies, Greek civil engineers

Vibration Monitoring of machines and the subsequent analysis of the recorded spectrum (Vibration Spectrum Analysis) is the latest reliable technique for achieving greater reliability on equipment. Vibration monitoring is the most reliable method of evaluating the general condition of a rotating machine. The spectrum analysis provides clear and measurable information, and allows the engineer to identify the condition of the machine. The method is applied by using special sensors placed on machines that measure acceleration, velocity and displacement. Spectrum analysis receives the signal from the sensors and processes it by identifying the frequencies displayed using digital filters and signal transformations with Fourier analysis (FFT analysis), Wavelet analysis and Hilbert-Huang analysis (HHT analysis) in computer software. The use of each transformation depends on the problem we seek to investigate in each machine. When a machine element is damaged or fails, a specific frequency will be stimulated in the spectrum by displaying greater value. In fact, each spectrum of the rotating machine produces vibrations with distinct characteristics in specific frequencies. These vibrations can be measured and compared to benchmarks in order to detect and make diagnosis of the failure.","ADMES has completed several projects with big infrastructure providers: Wind farms, Energy Suppliers (PPC (ΔΕΗ), Terna, DEYACH (ΔΕΥΑΧ), ITA Group, US navy, Theodoropoulos Shipyards, Plastika Kritis S.A. etc.) and it has provided its customers with technical reports including critical maintenance and prevention analysis and advice.

Our gluten free products with their distinguish greek flavor, contribute to growth internationally.Thousands of tourists taste our premium-high quality products when they visit our country and they use to seek for them when they return to their country. Our Revenue model  that we have established so far is  focusing on tourism sector. In Greece & Cyprus  (hotels, restaurants, touristic shops )mostly due to significant tourist arrivals from West Europe and North America). Also we have continuous increase of presence in the Greek retail market(35% of our revenue)  through major retail chain stores. Establishment of strong presence in the US through partnerships with local representatives and also further expansion of geographic “footprint” in new markets(Scandinavia,Dubai etc.).Exports we aim to contribute more than 40% of our income the next 2 years.
","Our funding needs are 100.000€ in order to develop our distribution means and  also to create new recipes which will focus on the promising and unique technique of infusing liposome capsules in our products which ensures that vitamins and other valuable ingredients could be absorbed inside the human body. Moreover, the lack of funding due to the unstable greek economy and covid 19 prolonged situation forces us to seek for additional funding in order to promote our products abroad and increase significantly our exports.

The problem in the field of Last Mile and Quick Commerce is the existence of huge demand for last mile logistics services & short supply.

The Demand:
- eCommerce rapid growth
- Demand for home deliveries on orders made to restaurants & cafes
- The rise of online marketplaces

The Supply:
- Few to non-existing companies specialized in home deliveries on small orders
- Outdated operating systems & lack of technological support
- Recruiting drivers is difficult as this job’s category demand exceeds supply

The Solution: G&G operates a fleet of 50 motorbikes to deliver
- An application matches orders with drivers real time and notify the closest available driver
- Routing, pick up and delivery time are calculated using AI
- Catering stores are relieved from the hassle of delivery

The Added Value: (G&G) disrupts the Last Mile Logistics industry:
- Book a real-time delivery on products
- Each delivery is done on a pay-as-you-go pricing
- Assurance on quality and timeliness of deliveries","An Advanced (B2B) Delivery Platform (we address only to Companies, not to consumers) where our partners are able to have:
1. Low Delivery Fees.
2. Fast, stable, trustworthy & Efficient on Demand Delivery Service.
3. Usage of an Innovative Technology to Increase Delivery Staff Productivity.
4. Delivering the goods (food, drinks, groceries etc.) no matter from which platforms (E-Food, Instashop, Box, by Phone, etc.) the order was coming from.

Green&Go (G&G) has a permanently active fleet in the areas it operates in and charges its services at an agreed price per order.

Customers (restaurants, cafes, retail companies, grocery, etc.) inform G&G as soon as they have an order to be delivered and one of our drivers will show up to make the delivery as soon as possible.

G&G always has active drivers in the dedicated area it operates in and customers do not need to provide any prior notice to the company regarding volume of orders or required time of delivery.","It is important to emphasize the uniqueness of the services of G&G as there is nothing similar operating in the market. As the company is first to introduce this service to the market, we are confident that it will create a first mover effect and have a competitive advantage over any other company that will try to follow and compete with us. 
There are currently some companies that are active in providing distribution to restaurants, however their services are attached to an online ordering platform (e.g., eFood) and the services provided are limited to the orders from that specific ordering platform - not the total orders of the restaurant at any given day.

Our future targets are the above (% of our income):
- 2023 TARGET: 80% Thessaloniki 20% Athens
- 2024 TARGET: 50% Thessaloniki 50% Athens. Also, opening to Europe, aiming to the northern of Europe, where Delivery needs are very high
- 2025 TARGET: 30% Thessaloniki 65% Athens, 5% Europe

The potential barrier would be unstable external environment such as fuel price, maintenance costs and overall operational expenses.","G&G enjoys 2 years of successful commercial presence in Thessaloniki having acquired and maintained more than 250 clients - this stands as proof of concept, market demand and successful commercialization of
the concept.
For all the above reasons, we are confident that the project will have a noticeable success in Athens (this is our next step for the upcoming 6 months) and we will manage to achieve our European expansion.

The company has invested a lot of time and financial resources in research and development (R&D), thus, acquiring techniques, which also allow us to reuse existing installed luminaires. The principles of the circular economy are mainly followed, since it is preferable to re-use a product instead of recycling it, as it is mentioned in the EU directive.
By applying those methods, the new product is fully configurable, with efficient LED lighting, repairable and reusable without wasting valuable resources.
Such problems arise with:

A) Traditional decorative luminaires, 
B) PPC tray type street lights 
","Our products are compatible with the technologically advanced cities and the -Internet of Things- (IoT) solution for complete connectivity of luminaires with a control center. There is a clear technological innovation in our products but also innovation in the way of dealing with the problems that our customers have. Our uniqueness lies in the design of the product to offer exactly the desired effect as a solution to lighting needs.
We offer have a wide range of lighting, capable of illuminating in three different directions and at a wide angle. 
Our boards have distributed LEDs, so that they can be replaced, when required, without the lighting being completely interrupted by the luminaire, while in the case of a power loss from some boards, the rest replace the lost power, by increasing their efficiency.
A reduced construction cost is guaranteed due to the nature of the materials and design used. Therefore, the construction of the housing can be made of plastic material, since the developing temperatures are low, while at the same time the total weight is significantly lower than a respective conventional luminaire.
They can be used for safety, industrial and street lighting, as it can accept variable automations 
They are easily mounted and adapted to any existing pillar, pylon etc, depending on the desired place, due to their ergonomic design. the combination of the above with our sensors and software makes our products eligible for Smart City Lighting.","We have been granted a patent by the Industrial Property Organization (OBI).

Our luminaires are designed and manufactured based on experimental tests and strict analysis of our project team. There are competing solutions that use other types of lighting on the market, but none offers collectively all of the advantages that we provide. After the design of a new product and the production of samples, we promote them to the customers. There is personal contact, with established relationships of trust that have been created through previous collaborations either with those companies or with other acquaintances who recommend us to them, (word of mouth).

We have developed and want to drive to production and the market the first Greek electric vehicle, a new innovative and fresh approach. Our vehicle combines a modern look, a futuristic simplicity and friendliness for the user with a series of technical innovations. Entering the market -and entering at this moment of “revolution of transport”- we target to play a key role in promoting a greener and cleaner future, based on technology and lean management.

GIVE is a technology & engineering business that provides technical innovation in the automotive field and especially vehicle electrification, developing innovative products and supporting new developments with advanced analysis and engineering methods. Today we have clients from China to US growing every year in project revenues and mostly project ‘intensity’.","GIVE has developed “ilektra”, an innovative two-wheeled electric vehicle for urban use (now in TRL7 with 2 working prototypes and 3 test vehicles) with 180km range, top speed of 80km/h and a three battery detachable concept for charging anywhere. In the core of our game-changing concept lies also our branded concept “You design. We Make. Together we Operate” which offers a “consumer-centric user experience”. Taking a completely new approach, we created a revolutionary offering, that starts from the way we design and approach our customers, goes through the vehicle life-cycle and ends at the end-of-life and recycling of the vehicle. The customer is at the center, with, the vehicle design, its maintenance and servicing, its updates depending on use, and the end-of-life, all personalized at every step. Our concept is based on three main innovations, the digital twining technology, the electronics and battery management system as well as the innovative assembly approach.","Our competitive advantages - besides technical performance & characteristics - lie in three main aspects. 1) our technology VIBRO, aimed to encompass a systematic approach that links the digital model, the assembly twin and the service twins for each deployed asset, unleashes the full potential of Digital Twins across the life-cycle. Purpose of this technology is to bring all benefits to the user in the forms of cost, unique, robust and quality products and personalized after-sales and support when needed or required. 2) State-of-art vehicle manufacturing: GIVE approaches the manufacturing process in a new way, directly targeting three of the Industry 4.0 principles (1) Modularity (2) Interoperability and (3) Human aspects. We created a game-changing approach for small to medium vehicle series production, that combines the F1 production system with an IKEA style assembly. 3) Battery system and BMS. 4) all above technical innovations, returns to the business concept namely “You Design. We Make. Together we operate” with which we create a business approach with our customers at the center throughout the lifetime of their personal mobility solution. Each customer designs online his unique vehicle with personalization going from custom color schemes and graphics all the way to power, energy management, comfort and driving modes, the level of human-vehicle interaction, and much more.

- GIVE is accepted at the Technological Park ""Lefkippos"", NCSR ""DEMOKRITOS"" as a startup company
- Within two years GIVE secured a 350k€ angel investment to pass the first phase and complete the prototype phase. We have now 3 full prototypes for testing and marketing.
- Vehicles are ready for the next phase of certification and launch of production.
- Looking for the next round investment to drive the next development stages. Steps remaining are: 1) Certification, 2) Assembly facility setup, 3) Market Launch

GIVE -to-date- has no traction from sales of its vehicles, but has numerous automotive clients with revenues growing significantly for project work on demand, based on GIVE's extended expertise in the field.","Our team combines world-class engineering experience at all levels, with strong market knowledge and business development skills. GIVE is a visionary design and engineering company based in Athens, founded in 2016. Focused on the values and passions of its founders and engineers, GIVE managed to grow significantly creating a strong web of partners and clients from the automotive, aerospace and energy sectors, bringing a fresh approach to design, analysis and optimisation of complex and innovative products. Founded by a former Formula 1 engineer, an Aerospace engineer and an MBA professional, GIVE has created a well-rounded team of professionals and a fast-growing team of motivated younger engineers, with the skills and experience, necessary to successfully bring new high-tech products to the market.

We project for a total of 37 jobs (26 production engineers and technicians + 5 engineers + 6 admin) to be created directly at GIVE during the first 5-years with many more expected across the supply chain.). It is expected that these will be a mixture of highly skilled engineering positions and non-skilled technical jobs for the production floor. GIVE, inspired and guided by its vision, created a holistic recruiting plan tailored to the needs of the local market on the basis of the “Universum Recruitment Funnel”.","GIVE is looking for a €1.1M investment, part of which has already been conditionally found from old and new shareholders. The investment will allow GIVE to (1) Set-up the production facility with the technology and method described above, (2) finalize the vehicle (moulds, design fof manufacturing), (3) finalize certification process, (4) grow the human and physical resources to successfully start operation and finally, (5) launch ilektra to the market. With a starting selling price of €3k per unit and a pilot launch only in the Greek market, we estimate approx. 5k units sold in the first 5 commercial years giving us a forecasted accumulated turnover of €20M and an average gross profit of €2M annually. Considering all capital and operating expenses (CAPEX and OPEX), we reach breakeven on the second year.

Besides the calculated and obvious returns from the direct sales of the vehicle, we believe there is significant business and financial opportunity in the technology created in systems level, but also in the attraction of ‘in-demand’ projects. We are already in discussions with interested parties for independent commercialization of parts (for example the use of our batteries and BMS system in home storage applications, as well as our unique Industry 4.0 facilities for small series productions of specialized vehicles.

We help farmers minimise use of costly pesticides, fertilisers, water & energy and increase the quantity & quality of harvest yield in line with EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), EU & FAO's Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) and UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We minimise expenses & adverse impact of agricultural production and help overcome climate change issues. We address the needs of crop inspection, early detection & treatment of plant diseases. We apply high-tech (autonomous robotics, AI, ML, satellite imagery, GIS & IoT) to detect & treat diseases at the source of the epidemic before they are visible to the human eye, eliminating the need to spray with pesticide the complete cultivation, which has enormous cost to the producers and the environment. We provide technology for selective fertilization & irrigation as well as selective harvesting, achieving significant cost savings on plant protection, cultivation and crop management. We offer information and enable optimal approaches on crop management, disease control, irrigation, fertilization & harvesting. We increase the efficiency of food production, while reducing the amount of energy expenditure to that end.","We provide holistic Agriculture 4.0 System as a Service. This way we minimise the cost of entry to our clients and reduce their risk and the actual or perceived cost of entry to our tech.

Drones, rovers, satellite imagery and IoT sensors are used to collect multi-spectral images (with extended colour pallet, similar to some insect's extended visual perception) and measurements of the crop. Data processing algorithms, Computer Vision techniques and Artificial Intelligence are than used to extract useful information such as plant disease, growth problems, lack of nutrients and produce maturity for harvesting. Other technologies allow for the generation of accurate and precise maps of the findings, enabling the communication of the exact location of the detected issues to other technological systems and to humans. Other, heavier lift capability drones, then fly above the affected areas using an automatically calculated path adopted to the nature, location and extend of the problem and selectively apply pesticide spraying or fertilisers as needed and only to the areas in need. When allowed by terrain conditions, robotic rovers can also be deployed to perform the same task.

One aspect of our solution is irrigation control by using IoT actuators and sensors. Another is automated spraying and fertilising. We also collect and incorporate meteorological data, satellite imagery and weather models to achieve reducing irrigation wastage by 20-25%.","Innovation stems from optimal agriculture 4.0 implementation made possible by our dedicated team of solution-domain-experts in the field of Engineering, Robotics, AI, Cloud, IoT and Big Data working in close collaboration with problem-domain-experts in the field of agronomy, environmental science, toxicology and biology.  There is also business innovation since we offer the system as a complete Hardware as a Service solution.

HaaS (hardware as a service) and Cloud Computing business models combined with Resource Sharing/Pooling models, afford us lower operation costs & greater flexibility as system operators, providing optimal capital efficiency. Full automation allows for scalability and entry to new national markets by small dedicated national teams.

We have designed our MVP with extreme scalability in focus since it is only based on pre-existing infrastructure (Satellite, Cloud, telecoms, app). We then move on by offering IoT farm conditions monitoring over app and smart fields mapping by analysing Copernicus satellite & drone imagery. Later we move to full services. We charge setup fees and provide services through subscription. There are initial setup charges, subscription fees for services, human expert support charges. We charge per land area covered, services and cultivation period. 

Our business builds around an environmental cause, ensuring economical and social benefits for all involved parties and makes its adoption attractive, feasible and economically viable.","We have set up an associate network to sell our services to their clients in three geographical regions: Crete, Messinia, Mytilini. Our associates enjoy the professional trust of our prospective clients for many years. We participated as exhibitors in 84th ΔΕΘ and Agrotika.

We are part of ICT Invent (NTUA), Ennovation (AUEB), NBG Seeds (National Bank of Greece) and Ok!Thess acceleration programs and have taken part, among others, in “the egg” accelerator (Eurobank) and Orange Grove acceleration program (Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), all parts of the Hellenic startup ecosystem. We are also in Copernicus Accelerator (EU) for satellite imagery applications. We are currently assigned four senior mentors and two coaches.

Aiming to play a significant role in the challenge towards green economy, applying environmental technologies that promote a circular and sustainable economy, the company plans to expand its activities, introducing and promoting to the Greek market new electromechanical equipment and technologies.","This project meets the specific needs that arises in the industry to seek and develop economically viable and technically efficient methods of wet industrial waste management. This need is urgent in our time, as we often hear scientists reporting the huge problem of aquifer contamination, resulting in the contamination of almost all foods in the food chain (fruits, vegetables, fish and meats that are polluted with heavy metals as they are watered by contaminated rivers and boreholes). The stricter legislation imposed today, as a consequence of the catastrophic effects of groundwater contamination on the environment, but also on humans themselves, encourage industries to develop innovative treatment methods, which will be efficient, but also economical sustainable. This proposal attempts to address this problem by developing an innovative pilot unit, combining high efficiency in the removal of pollutants and reduced processing costs. 
It is proposed to develop an industrial wastewater treatment plant, which will be placed in the effluent of the biological treatment of each industry (tertiary treatment) and will include three fluid beds (continuous reactors). Each of the fluid beds will be filled with a different filler (mineral, modified mineral and compost or microorganism culture), to allow each bed to remove a different type of pollutant, in order to allow the entire system to efficiently process the fluids waste produced by any type of industry. ","The key elements of innovation of this project are:
• For the first time, a unit is created, which can efficiently treat the liquid waste produced by any form of industry and with any combination (cations, anions, non-polar organic compounds).
• For the first time, a unit is created, with high efficiency in the removal of polluting liquid industrial waste, which has low installation and operation costs and is sustainable.
• For the first time, a unit is created that can remove hexavalent chromium from liquid industrial waste, which also contains many more forms of anionic and cationic pollutants and also converts it, by reducing it to trivalent, to a non-toxic form.

This project is aimed at industries that produce liquid waste loaded with heavy metals and other pollutants, small and medium-sized enterprises in the private sector, the domestic industry, as well as public sector entities. ","The actions that have been achieved so far are divided into two stages. In the first stage, an extensive literature review on the current situation of industrial techniques, in order to identify and document the extent of the problem, as well as the existing technical solutions to address it, so that at a later stage, they are put in a comparative perspective with the proposed one. The implementation of this action was carried out through research, analysis of wastewater samples, questionnaires on the management of their treatment and compliance with the legal framework, as well as semi-structured interviews. The research results combined with the three dissertations were extended and transformed into a new theoretical approach, which incorporates the findings of stage one, responding substantially to problems that have been detected empirically.
In the second stage, the creation of a general-purpose pilot unit took place, which aims at investigating the production of experimental processes in real conditions, for the control of their properties and the scaling of size. It was also the control of feasibility and utilization, as well as the optimization of the proposed processes.
","Dr Markos Margaritis is the CEO and one of the founders of Hellakmon. He holds a degree in Chemical Engineering and holds a PhD from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), in the field of waste management and design of chemical reactors/bioreactors, entitled ""Utilization of the biodegradable system with the use of pre-waste type. 

The second member of the research team is Mr Konstantinos Tsikas, as Chief Knowledge Officer. He is also one of the founders of the company. He has significant professional experience in strategic and business planning, organizational restructuring and business reorganization, project management and coordination, business planning, coordination and evaluation, and the transfer of explicit and implicit knowledge within a group or organization.

This is affected by the available resources as well as the time and effort needed in order to develop such a video game, not to mention that the timespan between designing and developing a game can render the research out-of-date. In this direction, the limited number of large-scale randomized control trials by research and education experts, are keeping organizations and clinicians from utilizing specialized video games in a clinical setting for special educational needs (Mahon-Daly & Jeyasingam, 2021), and this is a gap that we wish to fill.
","Our product is a therapy design software for people with special educational needs; eye movement, focus, response time, hand-eye coordination, time management and much other information are recorded, while the patient reads a specific text, listens to a sound, watches a video, plays a game in general, in an environment where colors, shapes, sizes, speed, rules, objectives and many more elements of the game are fully customizable. Since video game therapy is limited due to lack of large-scale research, our product's research use allows us to collect data in different custom-made conditions and generate descriptive statistics based on the subjects' performance, while giving the user-expert the opportunity to compare results between conditions. This way users can plan their game therapy in order to work on specific skills, in conditions designed and continuously adjusted to their performance progress by their healthcare provider, while their profiles' progress is being tracked.
","Our unique selling proposition can be summarized in three letters; CCA, Customizable, Comprehensive, Accessible. The software uses all kinds of stimuli (video games, text, video, audio) and records all responses, this way the professional gets every possible information. Every aspect in video and audio used is customizable (colors, shapes, sizes, speed, rules, objectives and many more elements of the game are fully customizable), so the tool is fully adaptable. The software's comprehensive nature takes into consideration the modern special education professional and their multifaceted role as a researcher, evaluator and therapy clinician. Finally, the fact that it can be controlled using eye gaze and sounds makes it truly accessible to every patient.
When it comes to our scalability, we expect to double our turnover every year for the first 6 years. We begin to project profits during the 4th year, with a substantial growth (at a rate of 2,5) each year after that. In regards to jobs, we expect to have around 50 new job positions by year 6. Our growth strategy mainly focuses on product development. Our goal is to launch new products in the special education market. Our products will be obtained as a result of the AI training based on the data collected from our existing products. We intend to explore unexplored markets as well, like psychologists and therapists working with kids focusing on our video game therapy use.

The company commercialises a platform technology developed at the Physics Department (Cavendish Laboratory) of The University of Cambridge. 
HL's technology can increase survival rates (demonstrated in human clinical studies) and has the potential to replace chemotherapy (demonstrated in animal studies).


","Despite advances, current cancer treatment protocols are still accompanied by residual high mortality (cancer remains the second leading cause of deaths) and serious side effects, as well as high direct and indirect costs. 18 million new cancer cases and 9.6 million cancer-related deaths occurred in 2017. There is also a burden to the overall economy due to reduced productivity of patients, as well as a dramatic impact on the quality of life of the patients and their family. In Europe the annual cancer-related cost is €140 billion, while just in the UK, NHS costs were €5.6 billion (2015) and costs to society as a whole (including loss of productivity) were €19 billion. The need and opportunity that HLECTRON addresses is to reduce the cancer burden for the patient, healthcare systems and society, by improving the treatment outcome. HLECTRON' s TOSCA project is a business breakthrough innovation project aimed at replacing systemic chemotherapy, thus minimizing side effects and disruptively improving both clinical and economic outcomes of cancer treatment. Thus, TOSCA has the potential to change the dynamics of healthcare-cancer treatment market, as well as address a major societal challenge. ","The technology platform was developed within the framework of a major collaborative international program launched at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge in 2011, along with the spin off companies Cambridge BioMagnetics (CBM), Cavendish NanoTherapeutics (CNT). The founders of CBM, CNT, founded HLectron in Greece, transferring know-how in business and science.
The Immediate Impact of TOSCA is lowering the costs of cancer treatment by 15% (for instance, one less chemotherapy session to achieve the same result per therapy cycle), as well as improving the patient’s life, due to less side effects resulting from the reduced therapy time and dose. This will be achieved by increasing the efficacy of current breast cancer treatment protocols by 15% (potentially saving €100 million per year in Europe alone) by deploying the medical system MagTherm™. 
The Ultimate Impact is replacing systemic chemotherapy, a major breakthrough in cancer treatment that could result in 50% efficacy improvement and cost reduction. To achieve this, HL will market the medical system NanoMagTherm™ to healthcare industry worldwide, addressing more cancer types in addition to breast cancer. TOSCA has the potential to create a new market.","In 2020, HLectron was awarded the Seal of Excellence of the European Commission within the framework of The European Union's Horizon 2020 programme.
Prototype systems have been developed and demonstrated and validated in clinical settings, showing 15% increase in survival rates of breast cancer patients. 
Furthermore, Hlectron's second generation systems have been demonstrated to increase survival rates by about 40-50% in animal trials, by totally replacing systemic chemotherapy (no chemotherapy is given to the animals). ","Hlectron's founders are experienced technology entrepreneurs who have been engaged with entrepreneurial activities for more than 25 years, at Cambridge in the UK. The core team has an extensive network of very high profile professionals worldwide, with particular strength in large emerging economies, such as in Middle East, China, SE Asia and South America, ","Hlectron seeks capital from private individuals and/or VC funds, to proceed with the regulatory approvals of its products, generate revenues in about 3 Years and become cash flow positive soon after.

Apart from the limited portfolio, agents also face limitations in their geographical reach since they operate in a specific area making it difficult to serve clients who have requests in other areas. In addition, currently there is no easy and transparent way to collaborate. As a result, they lose sales and offer poor customer service. Homexpress is enabling real estate professionals to find the perfect match for their clients. Through our app, verified agents can easily connect and collaborate safely with other agents - anywhere, anytime. Thanks to our growing network, agencies can widen their reach and work with a bigger portfolio of properties & search clients. Leveraging the network effects, agencies close more deals in less time while improving customer retention.
","We have designed the 1st B2B matchmaking platform that connects real estate agents across Greece. By leveraging network effects and partnerships, agents can find the best fit properties for their clients and vice versa. 

Our network helps agencies achieve better reach, finding the perfect match for their clients. Agents get access to a larger  portfolio of properties/search requests and this allows them to provide better customer satisfaction and increase chances of conversion. 

Agents can simply register their client’s property or search request and the platform shows them the best fits uploaded by other agents. If they’re interested in any, we call it a match. That’s the ground for a collaboration. A key difference with other platforms is that every listing in Homexpress is open for collaboration. Hence agents no longer waste time knocking on the wrong doors and can close more deals in less time.","Our target is the B2B market niche, we are the only pure play platform focusing on facilitating matchmaking and collaboration between real estate agents in Greece. We provide solutions to our clients by improving their reach, expanding their portfolio and converting their leads into deals. Relying on our advanced technology, we match supply & demand based on compatibility score and AI powered matching algorithm. Our user interface offers high functionality and is designed to provide ease of use, working across all devices.

Our knowledge of the market is hands-on, our founder works in a top tier international real estate agency active in the Greek market. We have gained valuable insights on how the brokerage industry operates and what are its existing pain points. While other markets globally evolved, the Greek brokerage market still lags behind in terms of technology and efficiency, with a horde of agencies scoring low on customer satisfaction. We created a technological solution accessible to every agency regardless of the size or the turnover. Our business model is designed to promote volume growth through affordable subscription plans tailored to every need. As 66% of the respondents interviewed by the Real Academy recognize the need for a strong network that knows the specifics of the Greek real estate market, we’re ready to start filling the knowledge gap that exists in this industry, providing real estate agencies with the tools they’ve been lacking. 
","One of the most important moments so far was participating in the Thessaloniki Helexpo 2021 where we had the chance to network and present our product to the public and receive positive feedback. We were invited there after completing the startup business incubator programme of the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which helped us calibrate our business model. In fact, a couple of months ago we decided to do a crucial pivot. While in the beginning we were targeting the C2C segment, we came to understand that the competition would be fierce and the forecasted marketing costs would by far exceed our starting budget. So, since we identified an important market need, we decided to start with the B2B segment, test our technology there and then activate our more ambitious C2C plan. Currently, we have developed a fully functional MVP and started reaching out to potential clients.
","We have been working as a team for the past year. We have very diverse backgrounds but the same appetite & ambition for building something unique. We complement each other and rely heavily on our creativity and agility to tackle business challenges.

Simple, affordable and transparent.",HOMI is a hybrid real estate platform that puts the control back in your hands. Now you can enjoy the benefits of world-class real estate services at a fraction of the cost while remaining informed throughout the entire process. ,"Buying, selling, and renting homes has long been an arduous, paper-based process, plagued by inefficiencies, delays, and conflicts of interest. HOMI digitizes this process to make it faster, more efficient, and more transparent for landlords, buyers, and tenants.

As a buyer/tenant, you save time by booking viewings based on the owners’ availability calendar. Our listings include professional photos, virtual tours, floor plans, and the exact address of the property so that you do not waste time on phone calls and unsuitable properties. You build a relationship with the landlord, sign your contract, and pay your deposit electronically in 2-3 minutes vs. 2-3 days. You can prove your income via open banking to secure reduced rent and your bond is protected by HOMI. HOMI is free for tenants so that you do not pay the standard fee of one month’s rent to an agent.

Because of this, as a seller/landlord, you can attract a larger pool of buyers or tenants who have more cash in their pocket to make you a great offer. You get your own 360° virtual tour, DSLR photos, and floor plan to attract up to 50% more views. You can conclude deals quickly which reduces potential vacancy loss of 2% per week. 50% of our traffic comes outside regular estate agency hours, which means users can book viewings, send messages, and make offers for your property 24/7.","HOMI is the first platform in Greece with online booking direct to the landlord. HOMI’s technology allows you to arrange viewings, collect feedback and process offers quickly and efficiently, without needing to call a real estate office. The fact that you conduct your own viewings means that the model is highly scalable resulting in more competitive pricing and market penetration. With HOMI, only the landlord pays for our services, thus eliminating the potential conflict of interest whereby an intermediary is remunerated by both sides of a transaction.","60 completed deals or 15 deals per employee since our launch at the beginning of Mar-20.

100+ five-star reviews across Facebook and Google

HOMI has sold or rented 60% of the properties that we have listed and we believe we can increase this number up to 70%.

Regular landlords, buyers, and tenants, just like you, have saved a total of €300,000 in real estate commissions to date by using HOMI.","HOMI is a young company with a small team and large ambition. Our superstar employees and our fantastic customers are the primary reason for the progress we have made so far.

After workshops and research, we identified an emerging type of consumers who do not consider themselves as ""pet owners"" but rather as ""pet parents"" who equate pets with family members. Hoolie Foundation is an innovative digital platform, which is revolutionizing the insurance market by offering unique products and online services, focusing on solutions towards pet owners as to avoid not only unexpected expenses but also unpleasant situations having as a main goal the well-being of our beloved four-legged friends. Hoolie Foundation contributes to this by creating pet insurance products and by focusing on helping pet parents keep their pets healthy, reduce vet costs and prevent problems or injuries from occurring in the first place.

Our target is to further enhance our platform which will be able to connect and join to all pet insurance companies and platforms in Europe and USA with the ultimate goal of rewarding platform users with premium refunds and other benefits. This platform will be able to act as a hub for all pet insurance companies as they could also source the platform for their own commercial growth and scheme administration, become members of our ecosystem and save time and money.
","We have created an original, all-in-one, digital pet platform focusing on insurance but also with additional innovative solutions and services. It is easily accessible by all pet parents and automated through AI and cloud technology. With breed identification through AI, pet owners upload photos of their pets and based on the information contained in the digital environment, insurance is automatically rated, approved or declined based on the age, breed and weight of the pet. At the same time, the application reads (via scanning) the necessary documents of a claim, automatically collecting the data needed and within a few seconds the approval or rejection of the compensation is given. The information from the collected data is stored in the cloud in corresponding categories (profile, medical file, claims, treatment diary, prescriptions) and Insureds can access live at a moment’s notice.

Hoolie Foundation was launched in 2021 not only to help pet ""guardians"" manage the costs of their medical treatments, but also to help animal charities and animal rescue organizations care for and provide protection to abused animals that arrive to their family, through donations and contributions. Main goal was to fulfill this promise and we succeeded in making it a reality with the innovative provision of “Farewell”.
","Although we believe we have the best insurance product on the market, we want to reduce risk, because we know that many injuries and illnesses can be avoided with the right knowledge and precautions.By using cutting edge technology Hoolie differentiates itself in the market while at the same is focusing on the customers and their needs.Using AI and integrating insurance providers, pet owners upload photos of their pets, create a digital profile to purchase insurance products and store all the information, discharging them from the need to maintain physical documents, which are used for policies and claims.The digital platform also includes references to bibliography, educational courses, vaccination reminders and check-ups. Digital access to vets is another key point with added value featured to our platform, as it allows pet owners to visit the digital vet at their leisure and from the comfort of their own home, through video meetings with experienced vets 24/7 directly from their tablet or computer, saving time and money.Our smartphone application will be ready shortly. These innovative features effectively reduce waiting periods, the cost of medical expenses and minimize potential losses for underwriters.Our goal is to complete an online medical prescription application in a very short period and to fulfill such prescriptions orders, so that they reach every pet owner's door as soon as possible.At least 40% of pet health problems can be prevented by accessing our platform.","We're here to change the world of pet insurance!

Hoolie is the 1st Greek company implementing pet insurance design, an industry with great untapped opportunities of the local market and beyond.
By combining pet care services through subscription, it pioneers and innovates the industry even compared to similar pet medical care programs in the rest of Europe. 

Hoolie Foundation, is always taking into account the modern trends of the domestic insurance market. We participated in the 34th Thessaloniki Insurance Conference, which took place on March 11, 2022. Within the framework of the conference, the Insurance Innovation Awards were held, an important award ceremony for innovative projects and initiatives of the insurance sector. Our company won the 1st ""Innovative Insurance Product"" Gold Award. On June 2nd, 2022, the ceremony for “Pet Awards 2022”, recognizing Excellence & Innovation in Products and Services, was held. Hoolie Foundation again, won the 1st Gold Award for its innovative pet care program with a free of choice nationwide network of doctors.
","Highly trained professionals! 

All Hoolie staff are highly trained and familiar with all pet insurance services. We pay attention to every need and what makes us stand out is that each and every one of our customers is special and unique to us, as we are all connected via our true love for pets. Here at Hoolie we know that the entrenched view of ""this is how things have always been done"" does not apply. Instead, it's the open-mindedness that represents the “core” that sparks our excitement and creativity.

We understand how pet-owners feel when their pet is injured or sick and they have that feeling of worry and anxiety. We are here for them because for us our goal is to serve them and take care of their pet.

Why Hoolie’s platform? 

Our platform will turn into a system to reward pet owners not only by helping them practically (easy insurance policy issuance, fast compensation process, educational programs), but also as a reward for their act of love towards their pet financially. While all insurance companies spend money on advertising in order to acquire new customers, the investment in rewarding their existing customers is one, that HOOLIE will make it come to life. Our ultimate goal is to spread animal welfare education and to reward pet parents.
At Hoolie we believe that every pet is different and has unique behaviors.
","After the successful completion of our 1st phase and launch (proof of concept) without any funding but only from our equity capital and the increased customer inflows, for the 2nd phase we will seek funding. Our current needs are set at €800,000 and will include MVP MIS replacement with further features and innovations for our platform. This is allocated in the following structure: 60% towards infrastructure, upgrading the platform through technology can support the automated assessment of pre-existing medical conditions, and increase the detection of fraudulent claims to help increase transparency for underwriters and for policyholders. 25% towards additional specialized staff. 15% towards marketing & advertising.",,,"[{'title': '34th Thessaloniki Insurance Conference - \\"" Innovative Insurance Product\\"" Award', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2022', 'type': 'Services'}, {'title': 'Pet Awards 2022 - \\"" Gold Award \\""', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2022', 'type': 'Services'}]",,Bootstrapped,NA

Our innovation lies in the way we connect to the key systems of a hotel as well as in the advanced techniques of combining different systems' information on a single pane of glass regardless of whether these systems communicate with each other.

Our solution has a particularly large scaling capability since we are addressing all hotels and groups that have systems such as PMS, POS, ERP, PAYROLL, BMS, regardless of the country in which they operate.

Problem #1: Cannot Scale.
Problem #2: Not measurable.
Problem #3: Doesn't develop skills.

100mentors solution #1 is based on ""Micro-mentoring"". Mentors and mentees interact through asynchronous and byte sized video snippets, that allow users with low attention span and heavy schedules to engage and scale their usage.

100mentors solution #2 is based on ""Progressive Inquiry"". Our Machine Learning app assesses the inquiry skill progress of the mentee and the app sets learning goals for the learner to improve their questions to the mentors. Consequently the mentors are motivated to act as role models who inspire learners to further explore their talents and ask more questions that score higher. The app tracks the scoring and the progress of the mentee dynamically, and generates individual and collective Output, Outcome and Impact reports.

100mentors solution #3 is based on the ""Soft Skills Profiling"" mechanism. Based on the progress of their Inquiry Profiles, the mentees can earn micro-credentials for three soft skills: Critical thinking, Creativity and Problem Solving. Those are badges that lead to Certifications; the first of its kind (for Soft Skills).","It is scalable due to its micro/nano-learning nature and it's the first mentoring of this kind. 
All mentoring apps and programs require a rigorous engagement by both the mentors & the mentees, which is unrealistic in today's heavy work/academic schedules
Tech-wise its scalability is ensured through the automated Machine Learning (Applied Research) approach that assigns scores to questions and the Original Research of our team that makes the soft skills' assessment valid for the first time through a mobile and web app.

The innovation is that it focuses on the question, rather than the answer, unlike all the traditional learning tools.
This encourages a deeper/more meaningful mentor-mentee relationship, while it requires less time to build it.","3,150 active/paying licenses (~80% lead to Certified Mentor status), out of ~6k registered employee users from 33 companies in 17 countries.
Active user: >3 interactions (a mobile Q or A or a web live session)/month & certain KPI achievements. Social impact reach 110k users (~30% of those learners become certified for their Soft Skills).

Notable clients: 120 international schools, universities (e.g. Brown University), foundations (Prince’s Trust International), international organizations (e.g. the World Bank), employers for their L&D & employee engagement programs (e.g. EY, PwC, McKinsey).","100mentors continues its yearly growth pace of x2.5 p.y.(+150%/annum) until 2025, as the 1st micro-mentoring app for those learning organizations worldwide that need scale & visibility/measurability on the ROI of internal (e.g. teachers/senior students to students) & external (e.g. alumni to students) programs with thousands of learners. Mentoring has been a black box; we make it a high return investment.

This growth pace places 100mentors as the leader of the software mentoring space.

Our strategic focus is for clients/partners with more than 500 members where knowledge management is critical and we can scale the value that the organizations realise through mentoring in less than 6 months. We will become the go-to-technology to accompany every training (hard skills) program, with a mentoring (soft skills) one which multiplies the effect of the training.

The system asks for all the required by law information, that will be needed in case of a Health hazard event (Covid-19 verified case). And solves the bureaucratic problem of gathering all the required paper works for Greek tourism government-funded vouchers.

Just in Greece, we are targeting more than 75000 accommodation businesses as they all need a solution like this. As the system is translated in 23 languages Client and Hotelier side, we expect to also sell it in all Europe, USA Canada Australia, Russia, China, Japan, India, and beyond. Any Hotel or small BnB is a potential customer for us and we expect to expand the translations easily to more markets. We expect to use local hotel unions to inform the hotels of the software and give away two free months for testing. As the system was developed by a Hotelier for Hoteliers we know it to cover real industry needs. We are also going to us","There are several new ideas in the system. The hotelier is entering the number of persons of the booking so the form adapts and does not let the customer get away with giving the required information for all. We ask the customer to sign at the review of his data entry. We give the hotel the option to include unlocking the app URL and instructions for its use. We give the option to have customized per hotel notification emails and automatic reminder emails at adaptable by the hotel intervals.  The system produces a Qr-Code for completely contactless check-in at the reception with a very small investment required in hardware (a Qr-Core reader) by the hotel. It is mobile-first designed. It is multilingual for both the hotel system and the guest system. The data entry form adapts while the customer fills his information requesting additional fields when needed. It is disability-friendly. The system has an advanced API for connection with PMS and or channel manager systems and can be completely automatic. We give the option for the link to be sent to the customer via popular chat apps like Viber, WhatsApp, and FB messenger. Soon we will have incorporated in the system automatic ID/passport security verification and/or online ID verification via biometric data comparison as a premium service for the hotels that accept the additional costs.
Unlimited growth potential as we will be expanding in more and more countries after major sales in Greece and Europian union.","Already done

Purchase online HourBus ticket vouchers and book time-tunnel spaces by selecting drop-in and pick-up HourBus Stops and times. You drop your QRcode marked packages at the nearest HourBus servicing Driver on time. We deliver to the digitally verified consignee at the destination HourBus Stop on time. 

You: 
Serve your business omnichannel, reduce supply chain transport costs, never lose sales, and stay competitive.

We: 
Prebook time-tunnel van spaces to profit in volume group transfers.

It is a win-win sharing of the last mile. Deal?

The contribution of transport costs to the total cost of the goods is high today, with the last mile the most challenging part. You need your merchandise located close to your customers and use your van-drivers fleet, transfer companies, or Couriers: the smaller the package, the more expensive to transfer on the same day.
 
Many people shop online today. Many single items expect to transfer from city warehouses to end customers around. Courier transport cost reaches or exceeds the retail price, and you ""quarantine"" home for hours, waiting for the Courier to knock on the door.

With HourBus, you only ""rent"" your packages occupied space when transferred. You can plan the dates, times, and benefit volume discounts, mutually benefiting from your pre-bookings.
","HourBus is an entirely digital global platform that serves local HourBus distributors' operations in city package transports, connecting selected city stations for fast intra-company, B2G, B2B, B2C, and C2C transfers at a low price. 

Customers purchase vouchers online, as they do on airlines, booking the appropriate space tunnel from the desired drop-in to any destination pick-up Station of the HourBus network. They arrange themselves to drop in and pick up parcels on time. All transactions are QR-code secured, on the cloud, and locally.

It is a time-based van system. Each van moves circularly in a District, obeying a servicing and traveling routine procedure pattern. The most usual is the Diamond pattern: one van, four stations, one Station per exact hour, service time 20', traveling time 40'. Neighboring Districts share standard Stations, where vans visit simultaneously and exchange packages meeting their trip destination plan.

HourBus Offers complete digital operations and tracking services to all parties: Distributors, drivers, and customers. 
HourBus e-platform sells the vouchers, issues the QR codes in the trusted information black box, and finally pays Partners on their dividend share with a next-day clearing. 

Use AI functions for accurate predictive analytics to maximize ROI per Station, Region, and day for the most suitable station selections.

HourBus is certified to fully comply with the new Systems-based BI tools and e-platforms like ENTELECHY CUBE.
","HourBus is innovative as:
•It is an entirely digital global Platform under the new e-Platform Urbanism. 
•It is an innovative transport solution for all B2G, B2B, B2C, and C2C.
•It connects selected stations within a city for package transfers from Station to Station, not door to door. 
•Transfers packages same-day, in hours, cheap, and safely.
•Customers deliver and pick up the parcels themselves to and from Stations.
•All transactions are secured Contactless by QR codes.
•Couriers, Transport companies, and Retailers will find HourBus faster and more cost-effective for their operations.
•It is fully certified to comply with the new Systems' e-platforms like EntelechyCube.
•Introduces the new Instant Revenue Sharing System for Partners
  
2021. Business set-up, Managers and Operating Partners', side Investor (optional) assignment. The side investor is a safe source of financing if HourBus has to fund a Partner's failure to comply. Kick-off on selected world cities.

2022. Expansion to selected significant countries. Complex District patterns to be implemented. 

2023-. Expansion to North & South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Africa.
","It was an idea that came into the pandemic as a logical solution for easing package deliveries in the city environment from businesses to customers. Facilitating deliveries away from the shops' doors and closer to customers' hotspots would be a win-win solution. 
We designed a method to transfer parcels ""by bus"" using vans moving in circular ""bus-line"" orbits at a schedule. Senders must present the package at the drop-in, and the Receivers will be delivered by showing the QR code issued at the drop-in.

Principal Parameters
Stations: At primary market places as Shopping Malls or habitat places 
Driving Time: Station to Station in less than 30' drive.
Vans obey the System at the rhythm of the ticking clock. 
Report automatically transmitting exchange transactions.
A van missing the rhythm goes to ""out of service"" status until retransmitting. 

We explored the idea further and found it a win-win and cost-effective solution to same-day transfers for B2B and C2C transfers.

We designed the e-platform to have the leading role and saw a broader international business opportunity. We added Revenue sharing of Expertise Partners to share lower risks as each invests in his expertise field.

Couriers will significantly benefit from HourBus, as both parties focus on their expertise field. Couriers to deliver, HourBus to transfer.

This process allows for the placement of carbon fibre tapes on curved paths (also known as fibre steering). Fibre steering expands drastically the design space for composite material components and can improve all aspects of structural performance. This, in turn, allows designers to optimise components and minimise material usage with weight and cost benefits that can revolutionise the use of carbon fibre and composites. 

 ","iCOMAT is offering a step-change improvement in producing lightweight and cost-efficient composite structures for the global aerospace and automotive industries based on the world’s first automated tape laying machine with the fibre steering capabilities


iCOMAT is currently developing an industrial grade tape laying head to further validate the structural benefits of its fibre steering process and demonstrate the business case through pilot projects (eg production rate and cost for specific components). Once this development phase is complete, the next milestone is to finalise the engineering of the head and launch it in the market. The head can be mounted on existing robots or gantries and allows for the manufacturing of high quality composite parts using fibre-steering, allowing manufacturers to produce components with higher structural efficiency at lower production cost. ","Current composite structures are optimised by stacking straight-fibre layers at different orientations. As structures have complex load paths, this approach often leads to overdesign. It is more efficient to design with layers of curved fibres, changing their orientation constantly to follow the load path (fibre-steering). Continuous Tow Shearing (CTS) is the world’s first manufacturing technology capable of fibre steering with no defects. CTS can steer the fibres along curved paths without defects by continuously shearing the tape during the layup process; a completely different way of manipulating the composite tape from state-of-the-art machines, which bend the tapes to steer their paths, introducing severe defects, such as wrinkling. Fibre steering expands drastically the design space for composite components and can improve their structural performance. This, in turn, allows designers to optimise components and minimise material usage with weight and cost benefits and can revolutionise the use of carbon fibre and composites.","iCOMAT has successfully completed pilot studies with leading OEMs, validating the benefits of the technology and demonstrating the business case (83% production time reduction, 57% cost reduction vs state-of-the-art production machines). iCOMAT is now scoping the setup of several pilot production lines to enable batch production of automotive parts and gradually scale-up to high volume production (40k-100k vehicles p/a).
iCOMAT has developed a platform technology; the same machine can be used for production of components in aeronautics, space, marine and any sector which requires ultra-lightweight vehicles. Although the core focus is the automotive sector, iCOMAT has several projects/contracts in these sectors.
iCOMAT has won multiple awards, most notably Startup of the Year by CompositesUK, Best Innovation by Advanced Engineering UK and is also representing UK at the JEC global composites startup competition.

The European Commission imposes heavy fines to Greece for the insufficient management of animal & organic waste. Another critical concern is the impact of food waste. Greece is ranked 4th among the European countries, a tremendous high ranking which has a negative impact for our country & thus for the environment we live in. The use of nitrate & chemical fertilizers and pesticides has increased rapidly over the last decades due to the intensification of crops cultivation. Due to the environmental consequences, there is an important trend to reduce their uncontrolled use for the sake of agricultural land, in other words, our mother earth. Consumers appear to increasingly prefer organic products and those grown under environmentally friendly farming practices. Therefore, it is imperative to develop new biological plant protection & bio-stimulant products that are able to support organic farming and meet their nutritional and plant protection needs effectively and at a sustainable cost.","Our company embraces the zero waste food management and the circular economy.
Ikorganic produces environmentally friendly organic fertilizers through the management of animal and organic waste by adopting the ASP composting method complying with all environmental legislation. As a result, we achieve the elimination of food waste by converting it into certified organic liquids & solid fertilizers and also into good value protection products. Our products contribute substantially to the development and further achievement of high production, both quantitatively and qualitatively, which is the desire of each producer/farmer.

A business incorporating waste management simultaneously with the production of new type of fertilizers, does not exist in Greece. Along with research and development programs, Ikorganic proves that this innovative business model practices effectively. Its purpose is the continuous design and production of innovative formulations of high standards and low cost organic materials. Thus, Ikorganic contributes to the production of quality and safe agricultural products, with appropriate organoleptic characteristics, fully in line with the needs of the market and consumers. The university institutions are trusted partners, who ensure Ikorganic’s successful course in the field of research and production of new knowledge. ","By the end of 2018, we had 4 certified organic biostimulants made from food waste.

Such technology takes advantage of nature towards personalized ex vivo immunotherapy and immunoprotection. 
The first goal concerns individual cancer patients with solid tumors and establishement of medical Ex Vivo Immunization Centers (EVIC). The application of the universally novel technology ensures personalized treatment, no side effects, no need to stop other treatments, fast results and specific re-application if metastasis. The technology expands to anti-microbial vaccination and immune regulatory therapy. The establishment of EVICs opens a new market in health.  Marketing the ""know how"" of the new technology opens many opportunities in business development.

  ","ImmunoRec orchestrates the application of Personalized Implantable Vaccine technology entering phase I clinical trials towards the first goal of cancer immunotherapy with active substance autologous macrophages, pre-activated against autologous tumor antigens, absorbed on a silicon surface. The product has been classified as “combined-Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product” (c-ATMP) and complies with the corresponding “Good Manufacturing Practice” (GMP) legislation. ImmunoRec is contracting with a Laser Laboratory, a Diagnostic Laboratory, a Tissue Laboratory and a General Clinic in order to get the product to the patient. ","The technology promoted by ImmunoRec focuses on human health and its slogan is ""You can heal yourself"". It is based on a silicon (SiO2, raw form of glass) implant specially treated with ultra-fast laser, which carries the individual's peripheral blood cells and which are activated outside the body either with non-infectious fragments of the pathogenic microorganism, or with autologous biopsy extracts from a cancer patient, and then implanted subdermally into the respective host, attracting immune cells to the implantation site, which recognize the stimulus and respond properly.
Such universally novel technology is expected to change the map of personalized therapy, where the product is man-centered providing job opportunities to thousands of scientists, while respecting the patients needs, avoiding on-target and off-target side effects. ","Pre-clinical studies towards cancer immunotherapy, anti-microbial vaccination and immune regulatory therapy have been accomplished and ImmunoRec was established to exploit these results and bring the novel technology of personalized implantable vaccines to health service. The decision to pursuit the exploitation of the pre-clinical results has been a very hard, full of surprises, difficulties and unknown paths to follow. However, disappointment has so far been accompanied by a small boost of hope and ImmunoRec is still following the goal. After getting the classification from the National and European Drug Organization of the product, ImmunoRec has signed contracts with a CRO office for the clinical trial composition and a GMP office for the necessary file preparation. At the same time the company is being advertized, promoted, and involved in scientific meetings and scientific publications. ","Very few people believed in us. The idea was great, but in the world of business the valley to cross was immense. Along with the Property Development Management Company of the University of Crete, four people took the lead for establishing ImmunoRec: Irene Athanassakis who is a Professor of Immunology, in the Department of Biology, University of Crete;  Ioannis Liapakis who is a Plastic Surgeon, George Rizos who is a nurse and physicist and Ioannis Stratakis who is a physiothepapist. Anna Vassiliadis was placed as the Administrator Officer of the company. Collaborators and consultants at the scientific/operational, financial/management and legislative level kept coming and ImmunoRec now lies on 8 scientists in Biology/Physics, 9 people in the finance and management and 2 persons in legislation. Good science is a major key. But business is something else. ImmunoRec learns that the hard way and struggles to make science into real application. The whole team and collaborators share the vision for a better quality of life and need all help they can get.","At this point the funding needs are estimated to be at the pre-seed level.

in.mat-Lab is aiming at a most precise Value-to-Client Analysis based on market-oriented laboratory protocols. With results verified on industrial scale by its clients, the company offers critical information for smart mining and furthermore on targeted features regarding end products and their applications.
The response was almost immediate, mainly from abroad (Europe, America, Asia) and with significant assignments (B2B) from important companies in the field. Even more interesting, however, is the collaboration of in.mat-Lab services with relatively small companies in the field around the world, which do not have the ability to facilitate their own corresponding department, thus contributing to their development and their next steps in a highly competitive market.","The services offered, concern the holistic approach of industrial minerals. Standard methodologies have been developed for the simulation of manufacturing processes and the use of final products, in which industrial minerals are used. There are different methodologies for different applications, such as construction, agriculture, environment, functional fillers of high added value etc. In this way it is possible to quantify the effect of the use of an industrial mineral and consequently to determine its economic value for a specific application and market. Among the positive consequences are the ""smart"" characterization and exploitation of deposits based on end uses and markets, the ability to produce final products with adapted or optimized properties and the saving of raw materials and resources for both the producer and the user of the industrial mineral.","The company is currently the only independent laboratory in the world with a holistic approach to industrial minerals. Business innovation is related to the quantification of the value of raw materials in relation to markets. “Smart Mining” activities are strengthened and directly related to end uses and markets. Appropriate raw materials are selected for specific applications. Incorrect estimates, which could lead to significant losses of time, money and resources, are avoided to the highest possible degree.
So far, evaluation protocols have been completed for perlite and validated by industrial trials. The short-term development plans include:
1. Introduction of these protocols in AI (Artificial Intelligence) programs for the ""smart"" characterization of deposits in situ and selective mining (Smart Mining).
2. Enrichment of the portfolio of standard methodologies for other industrial minerals, such as vermiculite and sepiolite. The development of such methodologies is on-going.

Furthermore, the installation, as well as the service of the hardware, is carried out by a qualified electrical engineering staff, so that the farmer does not have to spend more time in the field.","So far we have 78 users, 4 agronomist partners and we have trained 47 famers (precesion famring workshops). Our system was installed and tested in the National Garden of Athens, too. ","Our team consists of 9 people with all needed specialities (business wise, marketing, agronomists, mechanics, designers).

128,128,214,INCOTECH ΜΟΝΟΠΡΟΣΩΠΗ ΕΠΕ,"Pireas, Greece","['Environment & Energy (GreenTech, CleanTech)']",['Cleantech'],"['B2B', 'B2C', 'B2G']","['Licencing', 'Price per Item']","['Grant', 'Self']",Design and development of decentralised integrated biowaste valorisation solutions,"Biowaste comprises 50-70% of total Municipal Solid Waste and its untreated disposal poses significant risks to the environment, including over 3.3 Gt of carbon emissions annually. Population growth and increasing consumption patterns are bound to intensify biowaste generation. In response, EU regulations and policy for a cleaner and more competitive Europe, including their national adaptations, promote the diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill towards a circular economy framework.
Composting is a natural method for converting biowaste to nutrient-rich soil amendment, thus providing a sustainable path of organic matter recycling. Nevertheless, existing composting solutions typically focus on high capital cost central facilities which incur additional management, transportation, and operation costs and require time to build. Therefore, our optimistic biowaste reduction goals will be unattainable unless we adopt decentralized processes that target large biowaste producers like hotels, hospitals, and universities.
Turning this global challenge into an opportunity, INCOTECH specializes in designing and developing innovative decentralised biowaste valorisation solutions that are commercially available off-the-shelf.","Mechanical Composting Units (or municipal composing units) bridge the gap between household and centralized composting in the sense that (a) they can be installed where biowaste is produced, (b) have few limitations in the incoming source-separated biowaste, (c) process biowaste on-site with little supervision, and (d) produce high quality compost which can optionally be used on-site. These composting units constitute ideal infrastructure for large biowaste producers, either private (hotels and other hospitality services) or public (small settlements, parks, hospitals, etc.), and provide a sustainable alternative biowaste management option.
Mechanical Composting Units are the core product of INCOTECH, with 5 models currently being commercially available off-the-shelf. Depending on model capacity, annual biowaste input ranges between 20 and 225 tons and annual compost production ranges between 10 and 120 tons. Complementary equipment includes bin-lifters, weighting systems, and other engineering solutions aiming to support pay-as-you-throw schemes and ensure safety and traceability.","INCOTECH has introduced the innovation of Solar Mechanical Composing (SMEC) which uses direct solar energy to support the biological process of composting, thus keeping energy and bulking agent requirements to a minimum and remaining environmentally friendly. Furthermore, INCOTECH aims to produce the first energy-autonomous models by 2022. Considering the targeted market segment (the Mediterranean hospitality sector), these innovations will increase our competitive advantage and drive our sales to render our products part of the standard infrastructure for biowaste management and reclamation.
At the national scale, the adaptation of 2018/851/EC updates the targets for biowaste reduction and introduces financial incentives to private entities for on-site biowaste management, thus creating new business opportunities for waste producers and managers. INCOTECH has gained significant advantage by establishing itself in the local market of biowaste processing early on. Several international markets have already adopted pay-as-you-throw and decentralized composting solutions. INCOTECH is tapping these markets under two models: (a) establishing a strong network of distributors among the leaders of waste management infrastructure providers, to resell our commercial products, and (b) licensing manufacturing where shipping is unsustainable, including outsourcing manufacturing. Both models allow INCOTECH to increase international market penetration, drive sales and increase revenues.","After rigorous testing, the first SMEC composting units received a CE conformity marking in 2018 and the first models were manufactured in Greece. Apart from private sales, since 2018 INCOTECH has successfully completed public contracts of over 0.5 M€ in Greece and Cyprus for the supply and installation of over 10 SMEC units, including supporting infrastructure for pay-as-you-throw municipal solid waste management schemes. 
While the total number of composting unit currently installed in Greece is unknow, we assess that INCOTECH has already cover a significant share of the existing market in terms of both units and installed capacity, especially for public entity clients. 
Following up on concluded contracts, we are currently negotiating annual service and support contracts with our clients. Furthermore, INCOTECH has secured public and private contracts worth over another 0.5 M€, scheduled to be delivered within 2021.","Leonidas Drikos, Naval Architect and Mechanical Engineer with an MSc in Applied Economics & Finance, is an expert in integrated mechanical engineering solutions, robotics, and automation. As co-founder of the cooperating company GLAFCOS MARINE LTD (glafcos-marine.com), Leonidas Drikos has participated in several national and EU-funded research and development projects pertaining to mechanical engineering research and innovation in automation and robotics.
INCOTECH draws additional knowhow and on-site support from a team of freelance engineers, scientists, and technicians with extensive experience in the field of waste management and composting, as well as the integration of biowaste into the foundations of these processes. 
INCOTECH has gained additional experience from existing composting unit installations and day-to-day communication with existing and potential clients, and constantly updates software and hardware based on their needs. By maintaining design and manufacturing in Greece, INCOTECH not only provides excellent support to local customers, but also constantly builds knowhow to stay on top of the market.","So far, INCOTECH has been exclusively self-funded. To sustain existing operations, over the next 5 years, INCOTECH will require additional funding for creating 5 permanent jobs (engineers, technicians, and sales representatives), outsourcing part of the manufacturing (customized parts), office space, publicity, participation in trade fairs, as well as research and development. We also foresee costs for filing own patents and licensing patents owned by other parties. On top of these expenses, due to the significant cost of the produced machinery and the long repayment period from the public sector, INCOTECH has high requirements for working capital. Based on these requirements, to sustain existing operations INCOTECH’s funding needs for the next 5 years are estimated at 3.0 M€. During the same period, INCOTECH will also require 5.0 M€ to bring new composting machinery (currently at TRL 4) to the market, and 7.0 M€ to industrialize the entire production line.",,,,,Bootstrapped,NA

We are based on the Kimmeria University Campus in Xanthi, Greece, at the ATHENA Research Center.

We develop technologies for innovative energy applications, including battery, sensors, and photovoltaic cells technologies. 

We focus on advanced Li-ion batteries, and we provide technology for high-energy density batteries that eliminate the low temperature challenge (cold challenge) and enable sustainable mobility for all.
 
INEM envisions a future where Li-ion batteries will function beyond the existing limits of temperature, weight, charging time and lifetime. 

""Batteries Beyond Barriers"" is what we are striving for, so to enable movement in every situation and environment.

OUR HISTORY
Significant technological breakthrough and knowledge was gained for MNTL@DUTh via a series of Projects (2013-2019), funded by the European Space Agency for space batteries, that eventually led to a joined Patent  (Farmakis et all, PCT/GR2017/00030/2017-01939) for the so- called HELT ™ battery cell technology. This was Generation 1.0 Cell that addressed the “cold – challenge” and reached TRL4.

Given the experience gained , INEM Technologies was established, and continued the journey for tackling the low-temperature problem for Li-ion batteries.","THE PROBLEM
Li-ion battery technology is the most widespread battery technology for now and the one that will dominate the next 10-15 years era given the huge investments in the giga factories and the roadmap to the next generation Electrical Vehicle (EV) battery technology.

However, Li-ion batteries suffer immensely at low temperatures, especially below −10 °C:  low-capacity retention, large capacity fade ratio and inability to charge efficiently. Unless heated, the batteries cannot operate efficiently.  But external heaters take long to heat up the battery, add weight to the battery system, and have high costs. Typical EVs are heating the battery by resistive or PCT heating (pros: simple design con: high heat losses, long heating time, non-uniform heating, battery end of life (EOL) is accelerated. Newest EV models are integrating an external heating pump (Pros: known technology, Cons: faces limitations in sub-zero temperatures, adaptations in vehicle designed are needed).

OUR SOLUTION AND PRODUCT
Our Gen 2.0 technology, the AIM ™ Battery Cell Technology, makes cold weather irrelevant for EVs. Our technology can make the battery to heat up from (- 40 oC) to (+20 oC) in only a few seconds, uniformly, with low energy consumption, is industry-compatible, is safe and has low environmental footprint. AIM ™ Battery Cell is a self-heated cell.

","INNOVATION
For Battery manufacturers, Electrical Vehicle manufacturers and other Systems’ Integrators, our AIM™ Battery Cell Technology, is the most efficient Li-ion Battery Technology that makes cold weather irrelevant for e-mobility, because:  
1.theats up in secs, uniformly, with low energy consumption
2.tenables fast charging and longer range 
3.tprolongs battery life 
4.tis battery chemistry agnostic 
5.thas industrial compatibility 

SCALABILITY
Obviously, the potentiality of our AIM ™ Battery Technology addresses the global cold EV battery market. 

Also, given the chemistry-agonistic nature of our AIM™ Cell, the scalability of this technology is established in all the spectrum of the Li-ion battery chemistries used or will be used in the EV industry.

Furthermore, is scalable in terms of application: our battery technology is an enabling technology for several applications for the: 
•te-mobility and micro mobility sector (EVs, drones, e-bikes, scooters, etc.)
•tspace sector (LEO, GEO satellites, exploration vehicles, etc.) 
•tportable power tools sector
•tdefence sector (drones, surveillance systems, etc.)

Additionally, and based on its industrial compatibility, AIM™ Battery Cell Technology can be integrated in typical batteries’ manufacturing facilities with some production-line adaptations.
","Although INEM was funded in early 2020 and is geographically located in a regional environment (north-east Greece, Xanthi) has managed to attract the interest of the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA is funding our idea- Project (Q1 2022- Q3 2023) that brings our AIM ™ Technology to space batteries.
Moreover, we have established an RDI cooperation with Systems Sunlight SA, an international battery manufacturer and established member of the global battery supply chain, with manufacturing capacity in North US and Europe, i.e. Germany, Italy and Greece (Xanthi).  
In June 2022 we were accepted in the 10th cycle (6/22-6/23) of the Enter-Grow-Go (EGG) Innitiative, the Business Accelerator Program managed by Eurobank and Corallia. 
Finally, our IPR strategy has been activated and patent filling for AIM (TM) Battery Cell will be concluded in Q1 2023.
","In INEM we have the knowledge, expertise, and shared willingness to bring into market a solution that will make the green transition faster, better, and accessible to all. 

We have a deep understanding of the low temperature challenge for the Li-ion batteries . We all have engineering/science background (Academia, PhD, MSc) and our expertise is complementary.  We have entrepreneurial and managerial experience including project management and HR management.  

We have a large network of industrial and academic partners that could help us. 

INEM’s team have been working together for more than 8 yrs and we enjoy it. Our values are Trust, Credibility, Flexibility, High quality, Hard-working Ethos. Our team culture is strong, and we have persevered several challenges that would make others quit. We are flexible, creative thinkers and engaged in this journey.

The market for Electrical Vehicles is estimated to reach 35% of global vehicle market share in 2040. The EV market potential is unprecedented: from $246,7 billions (2020) to $1318,2 billions (2028) with CAGR 24,3%. 

Batteries account up to 1/3 of EV costs and data shows that 2,3 billion peoples experience cold weather conditions as part of their every-day living, working, and commuting. Unless, provided with a sustainable, affordable and easy solution, this 2,3 billion peoples, will be the last to enter the EV revolution, at a time that the green transition is more urgent than ever.","1.21 Million USD will be needed in the next 3-years period that will be allocated as follows: 60% Product Development (TRL4 to TRL6), 20% Marketing/Sales, 15% Operation/Inventory, 3% Legal and 2% other.

It was founded with main purpose to become a reliable partner for those seeking specialised and high-quality relevant services.","IMR SA has designed a prototype Healthcare Intelligence and Analytics Platform (HIAP) for databases with heterogeneous medical image types. HIAP will be leveraging historical medical images, using state-of-the-art Knowledge Discovery algorithms, producing interconnected disease-graphs. HIAP uses Deep Learning Neural Networks to automatically classify medical images and extract meaningful characteristics that frequently appear, allowing the discovery of unknown, until today, patterns. Furthermore, HIAP utilises state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Learning methodologies, to provide a thorough examination on each medical image succeeding in personalised patient monitoring and more accurate diagnosis. HIAP’s algorithms are trained using medical images coming from IMR’s anonymised database, which is a real-world database that has been developed by integrating anonymised data coming from one of the largest networks of primary healthcare units in Greece.","Innovation: HIAP’s innovation is [i] the fully integrated and user-friendly platform, able to accommodate any type of images and [ii] the advanced AI algorithms providing early and highly accurate diagnosis. The initial training of algorithms will be done using medical images from IMR’s anonymised image database containing a huge number of different cases, while HIAP will be a continuously self-improving platform using imaging data provided by clinicians.
HIAP will process image data generated from different sources and utilise state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Learning methodologies for realising a unique clinical decision support system.
The platform will be available as a software as a service (SaaS). Any prospect client may use HIAP in the future to provide a thorough examination of a patient medical image.
The utilisation of state-of-the-art image analysis algorithms in conjunction to IMR’s anonymised image data base (more than 1.5 million images) for training is the main differentiator. Today, such platforms are being developed usually in the framework of horizon research programs. However, these platforms are aiming at specific diseases while HIAP aims to be a generic diagnostic tool appropriate for fast and accurate diagnosis.
Scalability: Since clinicians’ needs are of the same nature worldwide, IMR’s platform could be easily scaled accordingly and implemented to any country. It would therefore set the example for implementation elsewhere. ","IMR SA is a startup established in September 2020. However, has already succeeded to develop a real-world anonymised image database, by integrating data coming from one of the largest networks of primary healthcare units in Greece. Moreover, IMR’s biggest achievement is the innovative ideas that arose out of our expertise and vast experience in the healthcare industry, while our biggest milestone is the innovative ideas that arose out of our people. Those ideas are the backbone of everything we do. Over the time we have used unexploited technologies that can be used in healthcare. ","IMR is the collective effort of some of the best-in-their-field experts in healthcare. We mix doctors, diagnostics’ experts, biostatisticians, and AI experts. All our team members are educated to at least Master’s level and our permanent staff and long-term contractors are academic leaders in the fields of AI.
IMR platform will be available as a software as a service (SaaS). Thus, there are not geographical restrictions and barriers. Consequently, the growth potentials are not limited in national level. The Global AI in Diagnostics Market size is expected to reach $1.5bn by 2024, rising at a market growth of 27. 4% CAGR during the forecast period. AI in healthcare is one of the most important scientific advancements in medicine so far. AI and Machine Learning have attracted the attention of the healthcare industry as these innovative analytics strategies become more accurate and applicable to a variety of tasks. As many studies have indicated, AI tools can perform just as well, if not better, than human clinicians at identifying features in images quickly and precisely.

The Innovitech brand name specifies precisely our main activity, Innovtation through Technology.
Every product we develop and manufacture is definitely going to provide something innovative to the market and the end customer. We don't copy, we innovate!
Managing director of the company has a tracked record in technological innovation, with his two last projects working for manufacturing giant, Jaguar Land Rover in the Electrical & Electronic Engineering department.
Inventor of two worldwide patents and worked on innovative project like bringing in the internet in the vehicle with applications updated over the air and ADAS systems (project management of ADAS architecture) with self driving vehicle technologies.
","At the moment Innovitech is still focusing in growing, so sales are imperative at this point.
We've developed a high tech self cleaning water filter for coral systems.
Corals are very sensitive organisms and require a stable environment, stable water parameters and a system with not many nutrients in order to keep their vivid coloration.
This filter operates in micron levels in order to remove the microparticles that obscure and reflect the light. Also these microparticles will generate nutrients when they brake down in the water column, so removing them with such precision maintains a clean and clear environment for the corals.
The precision of this filter is so fine tuned, that we offer media grades of, 9, 17, 25 and 32 microns to our customers, in order to achieve the desired effect in their unique system.

Derby University in the UK has purchased one of our products for their coral system where they study and research the unknown world of coral reproduction.
","Innovation in the current product is that we developed two products that can handle larger water quantities than any of our competitors.
We offer a model that there's no match worldwide in respects of water flow and volume of water that it can handle.
There's an innovative design and shape of the panels of the filter that is an innovation in the market, where with the research of physics and fluid dynamics we managed to achieve.
At the moment we have a model in the pipeline that will support large public aquariums using the same technology, so effectively the technology can be scaled to any level the market requires.

We are the first ones that used high tech electronics and optical water level sensors with custom software within them in order to cope in a saltwater environment with the respective impurities.
The next version of our filters will be using more advanced software electronics, interfaces that will communicate with advanced aquarium computers and we will be focusing on IoT and cloud technologies to provide the customer with more information at any part of the world.
More sensors will be integrated and we will be taking advantage of microwave and IR technologies alongside with hardware that can receive updated software.
","With the use of specific internet forums and social media, we were able to introduce and promote our product without aggressive marketing. The new technology, fresh design and innovations we brought in, the product spoke for itself.
We immediately focused on the premium price range as it was a premium product and the gamble paid off as a startup. We marketed ourselves as a high-end and engineering acumen company that created a hype before we released our products and that gave us a good traction with the market and bring some funds fast.
Because of our innovation we became popular in this industry and our products have been shipped out to customers all over the world. We are in the process of expanding our distribution network worldwide, and apart from Europe we have already started a collaboration with a distributor in Australia.
At the moment we have created a plan of what is required to scale up in the factory in Greece and what is required to scale up in the global market.
We have already got contacts in Europe, United States, Russia, Dubai to release our products in these markets with official support.
","The team is constantly growing and we have four people working in manufacturing alone. Two people in management and the director that will focus on the market expansion and new product research.
Already we have two new products designed and partially tested with extremely innovative features which will put us in the spotlight again for releasing new and different products from what the market has to offer.
We still need to scale up in staff and raw materials and that's why we signed up to Elevate Greece. We have the product, we have the technology, we have the plan and new products, but we need to invest more in order to achieve it.
All exports are done from Greece and we are giving the opportunity to locals to work on projects and learn things they probably wouldn't anywhere else.

At the moment we have customers and markets that want our products, but we have a limited capacity of how many products we can produce per month and we are actually losing sales because of our limited capacity. We never have stock in our premises, whatever is produced is sold already and shipped out.
","We need funds to get more staff, invest in our own equipment, expand our space and purchase raw materials in bulk which will offer us a better price per unit.
As explained above, we have the product, we have the market and we are losing customers because we cannot keep up with demand.
We are also buying parts from abroad while we have the knowledge to produce them ourselves but we don't have the funds for the equipment required. Some of these parts could be exported from Greece as a side activity for any excess we might have.
In our line of work and in manufacturing, there needs to be always stock in order to cover orders in a timely manner, and keep the manufacturing schedule out of the market demand. Manufacturing should be non-stop anyway, but orders will need to be covered in a timely matter, so any new orders will beed to be paletised and shipped the next day.
Any delays we have had in the past has caused us bad reputation and we are always trying to overcome this issue as our sales are constantly growing.
Also due to Covid, this industry saw a 30% growth when everybody else had issues. Our issues are limited in getting parts in a timely manner.

Focusing on spot and precision covering spraying, yield and crop index monitoring, disease and parasite detection, trains pilots according to the needs of each crop.","The ground spraying of crops, either by tractors or by human hands, has intensified due to the growing global demand for more raw materials and food. This leads to the demand for more natural resources and pesticides and increases carbon emissions. The constant stress of the soil with the use of tractors exhausts its productivity and drives the phenomenon of desertification. The combination of using large quantities of water and pesticides intensifies the phenomenon of the drift effect, creating significant problems for beneficial organisms and public health.
IONOS proposes and implements the use of UAVs for the precision spraying of arable and tree crops, and has developed an innovative spraying system. According to the integrated research program EXARCHOS 2020, which took place in inaccessible areas of Crete, forest protection was applied both on the ground and in the air with the use of drones. The results for the drone operations are very encouraging. It took 3.2 times less time and 5 times less amount of spray liquid than ground application, enabling precision agriculture to be applied on a large scale.

","IONOS is entering aerial robotic technology in agricultural spraying applications. The use of state-of-the-art software and hardware in contrast to traditional agricultural work is innovation.  Additionally, IONOS has developed a precision spraying system with patent submission, which can be applied to drones with a modification.

IONOS participates in a European network of academies based in Brussels, with its team being responsible for the network's agricultural drone training (European Drone School), because of the important operational experience. The overall software-hardware development of the product, the training, and the implementation process in the market is a unique and high-value solution, and a competitive advantage, because IONOS has actually found a way to fight fruit fly tree crops enemies successfully, in an environmentally friendly way.

The company’s vision is a transparent and more efficient food value chain, where food losses are limited and we can trust what we eat. Agritrack’s mission is to digitize the agrifood value chain towards a net positive CO2 ‘handprint’ and a circular economy for: 
1. Increased quantity/quality of food 
2. Better utilization of resources and harvested food
3. Improved consumer trust on Quality Labels and reduction on food fraud
4. Reduced operating and production costs for the agrifood value chain
","A platform that combines 3 core modules: Traceability Automation, Quality & Consumer Engagement:
1. The traceability automation module uses IoT and Cloud to track and improve operations across the food value chain (farm to fork) while ensuring compliance
2. The Quality module uses predictive food microbiology to assess food shelf life and AI to evaluate food quality characteristics.
3. The Consumer Engagement module is staged to provide a holistic view of the product’s story (provenance & quality) to consumers in order to enhance marketing, improving brand recognition and consumer loyalty
","We digitize post harvest operations and support business intelligence, by combining traceability information with quality information (eg fish expiration date) in real time.  Now, decision makers can decide early on how to process, where to ship or even how to sell / promote their product, as well as provide a fully fledged provenance and quality story to consumers.  This is Agritrack’s Food Value Chain Intelligence, which allows our users to better monitor food quality and reduce food downgrading and returns, eventually leading to food waste.  It also a) optimizes operations and b) reduces Supply Chain costs that have a high CO2 impact and c) helps consumers trust food quality labels, by interactively informing them of provenance and quality.  ","Solution utilized by 2 mid sized customers to optimize operations, tested and piloted successfully at one of the largest European aquacultures and across 200 dairy farms.

However, it goes far beyond the transport and logistics industry (i.e. transport, distribution, insurance, rent-a-car, leasing, courier, constructions, utilities, etc.). The majority of Telematics Service Providers (TSPs) fail to achieve remarkable success mainly because their services are fed by basic data such as vehicle’s location and speed, which are already very much commoditized. They do not provide an advanced solution that offers planning, insight and interaction with drivers and their surroundings.  

Newer vehicles come equipped with a multitude of sensors (fuel, tire-pressure, diagnostics, etc.) that when combined with mobile workforce management and modern IoT asset tracking technologies can generate big, invaluable data for millions of companies around the globe.","In the last few years, two significant events have transformed vehicle telematics: The dramatic increase of available vehicle data, related mainly to fuel consumption, diagnostics and safety, and the range of devices available to drivers such as smartphones, tablets and modern in-vehicle infotainment systems (e.g. Android Automotive). 

Our patent-pending technology, EveryGate deploys the high processing, communication and storage capabilities of the aforesaid devices and transforms them into an all-in-one IoT Telematics hub that connects everything to the Cloud: vehicles, trailers, cargos, drivers and passengers. The EveryGate app acquires data from the smartphone’s built-in sensors, the vehicle CAN-bus sensors and the Bluetooth smart sensors attached to drivers, passengers, cargos and trailers. The data are then securely and efficiently delivered to our Telematics platform which transforms them into valuable business information offered to our customers as a service (SaaS).","Currently, the majority of telematics service providers (TSPs) can deploy only a small part of the field data, which is the data generated by the vehicle itself. They totally ignore data from the vehicle’s surroundings such as its cargo, trailer, driver and passengers. This happens because the majority of TSPs are confined to the telematics unit retrofitted in the vehicle, and even modern telematics units are still focused solely on the vehicle itself (GPS, fuel, motor speed, diagnostics, etc.).  

On the other hand, EveryGate, the patent-pending solution developed by iTrack can gather information within, across, and around the vehicle. For example, by deploying IoT sensors (i.e. smart tags and wearables) it receives the status of the driver (health and otherwise), tracks the passengers & trailers, and monitors the perishable cargo. And more importantly, it does all of the above at an ultra-low cost. This makes the real difference, as it allows the gathering of this valuable added data in order to build pure IoT Telematics services not offered by 99% of the competition today. 

Moreover iTrack focuses a great deal on transforming data into valuable business info. While many TSPs try to sell fleet telematics systems as a service related to the vehicle, iTrack treats it more like ERP software attached to a company’s back office. This is a radically different approach because the true benefits of connected fleet services come from the overall IT system integrating together. ","1.

Our device,  the PULVAD, is a dramatic solution to the growing worldwide problem of heart-failure. 
","-The PULVAD is a unique Pressure Unloading Left Ventricular Assist Device that reduces the heart’s workload and allows it to recover normal function over an implant period of up to 6 months. This curative therapy is elegantly simple: the PULVAD reduces the pressure that the heart pumps against. Unlike left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) in current use, the PULVAD does not completely usurp the heart’s pumping function, causing it to atrophy and eliminating all potential for recovery. Existing LVADs save lives, but to do so they must literally sacrifice the patient’s heart. Like existing devices, the PULVAD can also be used as a bridge to other treatments, such as cardiac transplantation or permanent LVAD implantation. Unlike existing LVADs, our device is inexpensive to manufacture and its simple implant procedure does not require a cardiothoracic surgeon or a hospital with sophisticated cardiac surgery capabilities.","-The PULVAD, as a device aiming at myocardial recovery, presents significant advantages over the other currently available LVADs Our Solution PULVAD has1. Impressive pressure unloading leading to effective support of the left ventricle and intrinsic cardiac muscle function by increasing its pulse volume (other currently used LVADs suppress the functionality of the left ventricle by reducing its pulse volume). 2. Relatively simple implantation and explantation surgery or deactivation (without explantation). The surgical implantation/explantation of the PULVAD is performed via partial clamping of the ascending aorta, unlike other similar LVADs which require cardiopulmonary bypass. 3. The surgical implantation, explantation or deactivation of the PULVAD leaves the heart intact since it is implanted on the ascending aorta and does not involve destruction or removal of part of the myocardium, which is required for insertion of other LVADs 4. Pulsatile flow which is associated with higher rates of myocardial recovery. 5. Low cost, wide availability and easy operation. The PULVAD has a relatively simple design (no complex electromechanical parts) and low production cost ($1,7K), much lower in comparison of the currently available devices (short-term support devices $10K-25K, long-term support devices > $200K). The PULVAD’s operation does not required specialized technical personnel. Anyone with ΙΑΒP console training (even the patient) could handle it. 6.

Most of the time, digital e-commerce channels fail to deliver a 360, holistic projection, one close to the feeling given by actual, physical products chosen in-store. Thus, the product experience remains incomplete and does not attract the consumer in order to purchase, therefore the digital market does not meet each consumer’s actual needs. To specify, this problem arises as a result of the suppliers’ lack of a single data management space, creating chaos in terms of product information, not only within the business itself but also when trying to connect with other companies and platforms. Additionally, the image created of distinct products is often insufficient, having a different style of promoting several products of the same brand or company and significantly deficient information for each product, failing to create the environment needed for customers’ attraction and, therefore, market growth.","The solution to this issue is a single PXM (Product Experience Management) platform, where suppliers, retailers, and external partners gain access to product information all in one place. This way, Keyvoto creates an optimal online product customer experience, minimizing the endless back-and-forth communication and the time needed to transfer useful files or information, while managing all the company’s products and data in an effective and effortless way. The partner companies, whether they’re suppliers or retailers, as well as their external partners (advertising companies, agencies, etc.) are now able to process any kind of data within a single platform and be aware of which employee deals with which product and monitor any changes he applies to it at any given moment. Suppliers can now easily connect with retailers through an integrated API, while ensuring safe and unaltered transfer from Keyvoto to any of the market’s ERP, CRM, Loyalty System, or e-shop.","Due to the recent pandemic, there is a growing, dire need for digital compliance of products and general control in the digital environment, which makes it necessary for suppliers and retailers to work with a platform such as Keyvoto, in order to create an easy and effective sales plan, resulting to maximum sales for the company. Moreover, according to ELTRUN research, more than 7,000 Greek companies now own an e-shop, a number that grows larger every day. For us, this translates to significant growth potential, especially with the unique tools Keyvoto offers, which makes it even easier for a company to choose us as a partner. The only barrier to our growth potential as a company would be the creation of a competitive one in Greece that offers the same exact product as we ourselves do, and at an even more attractive price. Today, we consider such a threat very unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.","In less than a year, the company has reached 6-figure sales and 19 member team.

This Platform aims at increasing investments in small-scale renewables from 1-20MW  in the Greek islands
","Energy transition is a complex process, which needs to balance the priorities of novel technologies, economic growth, energy security along with environmental sustainability. In addition, energy transition includes a variety of perspectives, and an enabling framework of interactions between different stakeholders.

KiNNETIK, Energy Innovation Platform acts as a facilitator of the Energy Innovation Ecosystem to support technologies that are not yet commercially available to be ready for demonstration. This Platform aims at increasing investments in small-scale renewables from 1-20MW initially in the Greek islands and later in all insular regions of Mediterranean and Europe.","Scalability can be achieved by generating deals multiple times (same asset to different operators). Additionally, we foresee that KiNNETIK can be scaled in multiple ways: 
•tScalability at the level of the technology / innovator: we have secured the interest of a vast portfolio of innovators interested in piloting their solutions in the Greek islands and willing to provide sales’ fees for effective pilot deployment. The platform will host a wide spectrum of technologies
•tScalability at the level of the energy sector: Extent to which the specific technology (e.g. Electricity, Heating & cooling, Storage and clean transport) of the project can be applied within the sector and the expected emissions avoidance
•tScalability at the level of the project and islands’ operators: Plans for further expansion at project site and possible project’s technology transfer to other sites in other Greek islands and abroad at EU insular regions. Combinations are endless while the suitability of a specific technology or a hybrid solution on an island will eventually depend on the specific characteristics of the island itself: its distance to mainland, its natural resources, whether it is interconnected to the mainland/other islands or not,

Every day, we deliver decisions to our customers that boost revenues, increase profits, reduce waste and enable rapid responses to changing market dynamics. We are an innovative service provider of cloud-based intelligent retail solutions, supporting buying, merchandising and supply chain processes. 

We want to create a sustainable retail world.","While retailing is a simple concept that anyone can comprehend, efficiently operating a large retail organization has proven to be a complex task. The main reason is the siloed approach that retailers operate their business and their supply chain. There are multiple business units performing different functions to achieve the same high-end goal. Poor communication of each unit’s actions and misalignment of the metrics used to measure performance, make it hard to connect the business strategy and financial targets to execution. 

Breaking silos is not easy. It might even prove a dangerous task. Instead of disrupting the business, we interconnect it by letting the system adapt to data and processes currently available. We’re developing a platform to leverage the data that our customers have, not that we wished they had.

At the core of our platform, we model the physical supply chain moving from a traditional deterministic planning mode to a full stochastic one. This allows us to escape from unknown uncertainty toward known variability by utilizing machine learning (ML) for better predictions.

We want our customers to focus on the end result, i.e. optimized, risk balanced decision recommendations. We provide these decisions as a service, while our data science teams are working on a single platform, that can align the business objectives and decision making across the supply chain. Our platform is highly sophisticated at its core and straightforward to the end user.
","We don’t sell Software-as-a-Service. Our Decision-as-a-Service offering provides business-focused, technology enabled, highly agile in-house data science teams that utilize our platform to help customers achieve value quickly. Building a partnership with our clients, we accelerate time-to-value over a traditional implement and learn approach; and we provide much greater flexibility than working with a large consulting firm.

In most cases customer data is almost certainly worse off than they think it is. Retailers usually never look at their operational, customer, or transaction data. To expect quick results, we first deploy our automated data cleansing processes along with data integrity and anomaly detection checks.

The world of supply chain is more complex and uncertain than ever before. We model supply chains with powerful probabilistic frameworks to embed real world uncertainty and mitigate risk. We emphasize and invest in elastic, highly scalable, and high-performance cloud-native service-oriented architectures.

Analytics capability is expensive, sometimes prohibitively so. We are offering a service that will provide better decisions and it will pay for itself in a very short time frame.

We believe that the pandemic has made clear to retail organizations that uncertainty is something that cannot be neglected as it can heavily disrupt operations. Having a holistic approach to handle uncertainty, provides us and  our customers a great advantage against competition.","In 2018, we developed our first functional solution prototype.
   
In 2019, we validated our platform with a real test-case on a small-size (100 million revenue) customer in Middle East and proved its value. We have converted the trial customer to our first subscription. 

In 2020, we developed the Decision-as-as-Service model and successfully applied it on our first enterprise customer.

In 2021, we acquired a new medium sized customer (0.5-1 billion revenue) in Middle East after a successful pilot using our platform. This gave us the ability to test the platform and the service model scalability, in a real-world scenario.

In 2022, we’re completing our ISO 27001 certification, improving our operation processes and planning to rollout additional services to existing and new customers in Middle East.

The industry is still in the ""analog"" ERA. 67% of the companies manage their reservations through emails and multiple calendars. Additionally, 40% check their customers against printed lists. These are error-prone and time-consuming flows. Most importantly, though, the travel industry is not yet interconnected. 

So kleesto provides all the required digital infrastructures to enable the digitalization & automation of daily operations. It helps the creation of local travel ecosystems through tools handed to the tour operators and finally contributes to the growth of these ecosystems. 

We are addressing our service directly to Travel Agencies, Tour Operators, and Destination Management Companies. Their operation involves many external partners; these partners form the ecosystem of each company. Indirectly we can get to them and convert them to clients. 

In short, by approaching the central entity, we leverage the network effect to help us reach the rest companies of its ecosystem.
kleesto is addressing the industry of on-ground travel services, everything that happens in the destination except accommodation and flights. The market was $586B in 2019, with a CAGR of 18%, and is expected to reach 1627B in 2027. The industry is fragmented and low-tech in general, according to Phocuswright's research.","kleesto offers a platform for tour and experience distribution and administration. Providing solutions for organizing and operating a Tour-Operator or Destination Management Company we focus on enhancing booking operations. We digitalize operations that experience providers run for managing their equipment, resources, and personnel and allow our clients to connect with new distribution channels directly. 

On top of that, we provide a wide range of options for starting and managing external booking sources and collaborations with travel agents, OTAs, marketplaces, hotels, and 3rd-party experience providers. Preset workflows and automation allow connectivity and communications handling that helps tour operators focus on what they do best. To eliminate everyday struggles like booking management, communications with partners, availability updates, partnerships, deal-management, distribution syncing, and resource management, kleesto gives an easy-to-use platform so tour operators can overview all the transactions without worrying about the business-as-usual repetitive operations. 

Having covered all the base requirements, kleesto brings in cutting-edge technologies helping tour operators optimize their business growth. kleesto can introduce traits like dynamic pricing and yield management, dynamic package generation, automated handling of schedules, resources, traffic-based availability, seasonality, and enhanced company performance.","Kleesto was developed through an iteration process of feedback with our users, leading to satisfied customers referring us to their associates and partners. Based on that we established an organic viral loop framework with its roots in distribution and communication automations provided for the threefold “Channels-Vendors-Suppliers''; an example is the case of a Private Transfers’ client which connected, as a vendor, with 400 Channels and 300 Suppliers.

Furthermore, after a pilot with an important gastronomic marketplace in Greece partnered with more than 300 suppliers, we identified the opportunity and focused on destination-oriented sustainable collaboration environments, in targeted geographic segments, that increase value for travelers, travel agents, hotels and local experience & travel service providers; an example is a customer in Antigua & Barbuda, Caribbean, operating one of the most significant tourism marketplaces with local vendors in the area.

During the pandemic, decision makers were uncertain regarding expansion steps they should make. Despite that, we can see the situation changing with them leaning towards investing in the digital transformation to optimize their operations, work more efficiently, and save money. The current barriers we face are tied to the financing of our venture to:
a. Improve our Marketing Stack & Conversion Funnels
b. Streamline our Sales Process
c. Fully automate our Onboarding Flow
d. Kickstart our International Sales strategy","kleesto has always been trying to stand by the side of the people trusting it with their businesses. These business owners recognized that and referred kleesto to their partners because of their satisfaction. These partners have already been using kleesto's freemium tier to partner with the kleesto client.

Examples of hyperactive profiles of clients with numerous connections with partners are listed below: 
Private transfers company in Athens. Connected with more than 350 Channels and more than 200 Suppliers. In 2021 they managed to double their revenue compared to 2019 (the best season of tourism in Greece) because of kleesto. While doing that, the market benchmarks in 2021 were approximately at 60% of 2019.

Destination management company in the Caribbean. Connected with more than 100 Channels and more than 190 Suppliers. It started from Antigua and Barbuda during the pandemic and expanded to Jamaica and Barbados.

Destination Management Company in Italy, working for the region of Piana di Lucca. Connected with more than 120 Channels and 100 local Suppliers. Started in early 2022 and aim to promote and enable sustainable growth in the region.

Gastronomic Online Travel Agency in Greece connected with more than 400 Suppliers. They are trying to digitalize the gastronomic tourism industry in Greece.

The Knifeprint platform consists of the: Knifeprint Editor(online CAD), Knifeprint Cutting Service(on-demand waterjet/laser cutting) and Knifeprint Marketplace(under development).","Knifeprint is addressing all of the problems of knifemaking with the Knifeprint Editor, the Cutting Service and a Marketplace. The Editor combines a user-friendly intuitive design and the power of professional-grade 2D CAD software in a single cloud application. The Cutting service, which is a game changer, allows knifemakers to “print” the knives and parts they have designed on the Editor, with high-end laser and waterjet cutting technologies on the metal they chose. After those parts have been produced, they are sent to the knifemakers’ shop for the final grinding, assembly and the procedures that can only be performed manually. Finally, knifemakers can sell their creations through our peer-to-peer human-centric e-commerce Marketplace.
","Knifeprint is the first and only (at the time of writing) complete one-stop solution for knifemakers. By applying the on-demand manufacturing model to the ancient art of knifemaking, we offer a unique service for both novice and professional knifemakers.

The Knifeprint Editor balances robust CAD capabilities with ease-of-use and unique knifemaking specific features (serrations, skeletonized handles). Some features that make it stand out from the competition are: Cross-platform online software (no download required), public library with thousands of template designs, 3D preview of design, import designs from DXF file or images, assisted creation of skeletonized handle. The Knifeprint platform is the only platform that allows knifemakers to seamlessly design a knife and then have their design cut on steels of their choice with a few clicks.

Knifeprint has the potential to place itself horizontally in the knifemaking market and become a one-stop solution for knifemakers. Knifemakers will use the Knifeprint Editor to design, use the Cutting Service to cut, use Knifeprint manufacturing equipment and consumables (e.g. the belt-grinder being designed) to complete and use the Knifeprint Marketplace to sell their knives. Knifeprint will also be where end consumers(chefs, hunters, collectors etc.) can look for and purchase said knives, being certain of their handmade quality.","Knifeprint launched the Knifeprint Editor beta in Q3 2017. At that time we had entered the 5th cycle of the Enter Grow Go program by Eurobank. While we acquired business knowledge and skills, we also continuously improved and worked on new features for our software. Knifeprint has also earned distinctions in other startup competitions in Greece and Europe.

In the summer of 2019 we tested the Cutting Service and fully launched it by the end of 2019. We also completed the development of Knifeprint Marketplace Alpha.
In 2020 we achieved 100% user growth and 280% revenue growth compared to 2019. We acquired important customers all around the world and have sold knife blanks to all major markets in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and North America. We started prototyping a new manufacturing tool and are also discussing with CERTH (Centre for Research and Technology Hellas) a potential partnership to research and develop cutting edge technologies for the Knifeprint platform.
","The team consists of Kostas Argyropoulos Kazakis (Product Director), Nikos Panagopoulos(CEO) and Giorgos Tsanaktsidhs(CTO). All members have studied at the Computer Science department of AUTh and contribute to the project as software engineers. Kostas envisioned the whole platform of Knifeprint before it even had a name. He has grown up with a family with deep ties to the Maker’s movement, and more specifically with his family business directly related to knifemaking. With that knowledge and experience he directs Knifeprints path by managing its marketing strategy, products and their design.

Focusing on food safety challenges in the global supply chain, we have realised that food safety professionals are overwhelmed with data, that need to be considered when it comes to food safety decisions, planning and prevention. However, the extreme volume of data, combined with the fact that they are coming in multiple formats, from different sources and in different languages have made it extremely difficult for them to process and analyse these data by themselves, in a meaningful and timely manner. At the same time, food safety professionals have limited time and resources, but also a huge responsibility, to ensure that the food we all consume is safe. Taking this into account, Agroknow uses food safety data and in-house technology to support food safety professionals to achieve this significant mission and transform food safety","Our solution FOODAKAI is a cloud-based food risk intelligence platform that helps our customers monitor, assess and predict risks across their complete supply chain in a visual, easy-to-understand way. It is a solution that can be customized to serve differently each member of the safety, quality, or supplier compliance team. This is achieved through a hybrid software & human workflow that continuously collects, translates, and enriches millions of global food safety data records from hundreds of official, trusted sources around the world. These data are then processed by internally developed AI algorithms to deliver tailor-made data insights and predictions about the risk associated with ingredients, contaminants, and suppliers all around the world. FOODAKAI includes a number of software modules that correspond to the various needs that food supply chain stakeholders have in terms of risk and quality monitoring of their global supply chain.","In the context of our innovation activities, we have invested in leveraging the power of new technologies, such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain. Big data technologies can help in improving the scalability of the food safety platform and in the harmonization of heterogeneous data. AI technologies can improve data mining capabilities and enable the development of risk prediction services.

This is due to the existence of intermediaries (mainly wholesalers, supermarkets, and grocery stores). Producers usually charge 25% of the retail price for most of the fruit and vegetables. In addition, the existence of the above intermediaries significantly increases the time needed for the product to reach the consumer. As a result, a significant percentage of fresh / sensitive products is discarded because it spoils or rots at various stages of the logistics operations. The above model limits the income of producers and consumers. It is also an environmental harmful model (multiple packaging and unnecessary transports due to the large number of intermediaries). At the same time, the rapid growth of e-commerce, which was further strengthened during the covid-19 pandemic, constitutes a significant opportunity for online marketplaces. Today, the digital transformation of logistics operations (e.g., digital twin and WMS) allows the establishment of more efficient P2C models, without the presence of intermediaries, even for the sensitive agricultural products. It is also highlighted that the cost of production on agriculture increased by 0,3% (2020 vs 2019) and 2,7% (2019 vs 2018). Taking into consideration the current energy crisis in the EU, cost reduction is a key objective for the producers.","Laiki.eu is a P2C online marketplace and logistics service provider that disrupts the model above, through the elimination of intermediaries between the producer of agricultural products and the final consumer. When the consumer creates an order on Laiki.eu, the product is still in the field! The order is transferred online to the respective producer, who then does the harvest on his farm and packs. The producers send their products to our innovative 2.000m2 warehouse in Koropi. Τhe option of collecting the products from the point of production is also offered. Using “Digital Twin” technology and a state-of-the-art WMS we optimize the placement of products ion our warehouse and the consolidation / grouping of the orders. Additionally, using custom on-line dial-a-ride algorithms we also optimize the delivery schedule or/and product receipt. As a result, Laiki.eu guarantees on-time delivery with low cost (efficiently), limited packaging and minimum Co2 emissions. It is highlighted that Laiki.eu is an added-value logistics service provider for the producer and not a wholesaler like supermarkets. Laiki.eu does not set the price of the product and has no retail profit. The producers are paid immediately upon the delivery of each order to the respective consumer. A new service of collecting useful for the producer biodegradable household waste from the final consumer is being designed in the context of further promoting the circular economy through our business model","Business model innovation: Our business model innovation comes from our unique value proposition. We are the only A P2C online marketplace for agricultural products that offers added-value technology driven logistics services to the producers, significantly reducing cost and time delivery, eliminating intermediaries between the producer of agricultural products and the final consumer.
Technology innovation: Due to the sensitivity of agricultural products we developed key technological innovations to support our business model:
(a) Warehouse “Digital Twins (WDT)” that support the design/re-design and layout of our 2.000m2 facilities in Koropi, allowing to optimize space utilization and the movement of different products. During warehouse operations, the digital twin is constantly updated with data to continuously improve operations efficiency.
(b) Warehouse Management System (WMS) to optimize inventory management based on the orders and ensure product availability.
(c) Distribution / delivery optimization system. A s/w with embedded custom “online dial a ride” algorithms to optimize “delivery to customer” operation and the collection of the products directly from the point of production (minimize cost and time needed).
Our technology driven business model and our technological innovations can easily support growth and scalability in Greece and abroad as storage optimization, WMS and WDT reduce the need on CapEx on new storage facilities in the short term.

Obesity affects over 1 billion people worldwide, with1 in 3 Americans being obese and many more overweight, and is the main driver of life threatening conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Diabetes in turn, is a leading cause of disability and death, and a major socioeconomic health burden reaching pandemic dimensions in our times. 
Despite the magnitide of the problem, anti-obesity treatments including medical traetments and weight-loss surgery are poorly effective, while both are associated with significant and often serious adverse effects. Similarly, anti-diabetic treatments delay but do not halt the progression of the disease, with a large proportion of patients eventually developing insulin dependence and diabetic complications leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
There is therefore an urgent need for novel more effective therapeutics for single or combination therapy.","All current drug options for the treatment of obesity and diabetes are targeting mechanisms that regulate appetite, digestion, lipogenesis or metabolism including the release or removal of glucose, or the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Yet, none of these treatments targets adipose tissue inflammation, the common and main culprit that drives the trajectory of obesity, insulin-resistance and diabetes. 
Lamda Therapeutics is developing novel engineered biologicals of optimized pharmacology and efficacy as an innovative approach for modulating adipose tissue inflammation and treating obesity and diabetes. It is also developing AI tools for better defining patients that would mostly benefit of this new treatment. This stems from years of research from the founders identifying a central pathway regulatingimmune system homeostasis at the adipose tissue which, when triggered prevents obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.","The potential of the company for investment returns and commercial success is enormous as this targets a major disease area in urgent need of novel therapeutic approaches, and a multi-billion dollar market estimated at >70 billion USD expanding. 
However, there are multiple and major barriers to the company’s growth potential. First, there is significant financial capital needed early on, as proper development of the products pipeline with optimal biological, pharmacological and regulatory properties is essential. This is a continuous process and requires additional injections of capital as the company grows and moves towards scaling up and clinical development. Second, there is significant investment in human capital needed with unique expertise in biology, medicine and biotech business development. Additional risks in project execution, the regulatory process, scientific technical attrition and investor patience fill up the list of barriers towards the growth potential of the company.","The idea got selected among hundreds of applications (with top score) to join the Egg Eurobank business accelerator in mid-2019.

Too many businesses rely on outdated technologies or work traditionally by trial and error, driving to time consuming and labor intensive with lack of organization, flexibility and control. COVID-19 is accelerating delivery business (commerce, food, grocery) and those businesses are struggling to cope operationally and efficiently. Mobility challenges are becoming increasingly critical, especially in urban centers. Furthermore, autonomous driving and deliveries will be the norm over the next 10 years internationally, relying on these technologies.","Lastmily comes with sophisticated technology to help these business to overcome exactly this challenge! This AI powered platform takes account their resources (depots, drivers, vehicles), the delivery points, historical traffic big data & incidents and provides the optimal distribution network every day!

With Lastmily, they get in numbers:

• 10% up to 40% lower costs (fuel, management & more)
• 15% up to 80% more stop points per driver

Its easy to use, flexible and plug & play. It does not require any installation or equipment costs because it works on the cloud, coming with web & mobile apps. The platform provides advanced features and tools to automate, monitor and get cricical bussiness insights for a continuos improvement. Drivers make fast and easy deliveries with the one-click per stop driver app which comes with in-app, realtime traffic-avoidance navigation. Operators can ask the platform for optimization at any time from any place, even when the drivers are on the road & new stops came up. Everything is getting re-optimized and updated in real time! Recipients get a great experience as they see live where their parcel is and the exact arival time with the respective route with delivery or return options!","Lastmily key differentiators (Globally):

Sophisticated Routing AI 
The great competitors' majority have implemented algorithms which are taking account static time costs (from point to another point). These costs do not consider traffic, which in fact, changes everything. This drives to inneficient routes and mostly, to not real/validated routes. (wrong times).
Our routing engine (designed by us) is taking account historical traffic (many times a day), road closures, weather etc. driving to more efficent (up 20%) and mostly validatable routes.

Really easy to use
Lastmily can be used easily even from industry-irellevant persons, although its complexity. Clean/intuitive/minimum clicks/our ""Mily"" bot helping our users!

In app navigation
The great majority don’t provide in app navigation, forcing drivers to switch many times a day between driver app and conventional navigation app. Another key point is that we have built this navigation (utilizing partner's libraries), so we have the technology, we can make it do whatever we want.

Interactive client portal
The majority don’t provide a client portal. Our portal can impress recipients with the view of the driver coming to them with the respective route (updated in real time). Furthermore, client portal will provide options to recipients allowing interactions.

Scalability: Our platform can work all over the world day 1. Furthermore, it works on cloud with on-demand computational servers for scalability.","At end of 2018 we started working on lastmily. The core founders participated in the team from the beginning. Initially we started designing and implementing routing algorithms. 

In August 2019 we started working with a distribution company to observe their work and their problems by collecting data guiding the MVP. 

In September 2019 we had the MVP (used by us) for 1-2 drivers and in November of the same year we had the proof of concept achieving a significant increase in performance and cost reduction. 

Then until August 2020 we continued the development and improvements, reaching the first 2 customers, 15 drivers and 4 operators. In the fall we composed the advisory board and started searching to raise money from angel investors & VCs.

Today, we have secured money from angels & we are in the documents/singing stage with an important VC with an initial valuation of €1.1m premoney. Furthermore, we started our commercial plan execution with targated campaigns, publicity actions and contacts with national leads.","Growth strategy in three steps

Pre-seed round: initial launch of Lastmily piloting in Greek market aiming to acquire 400 drivers, patternize our sales, addressing our growth engine & improving our product in an agile circle. 

Seed round: Massive marketing investment to scale up in Greece and introduce our product in other countries & developing structures for different revenue streams. 

Growth round: Scale up in other countries - generating different revenue streams. 

The only growth-barrier is that B2B companies will rise, selling routing AI services via API to traditionall telematics/fleet management companies, turning them into competitors ( with comparative disadvantages in relation to us). We aim to turn this barrier into an opportunity by creating a taskforce selling routing services to other platfroms/vendors. Furthermore, we aim to expand in lastmile services, creating different revenue streams.

There are exit opportunities in Global industry Leaders (for market penetration), Location intelligence leaders and Major logistics providers. The two main reasons triggering an exit are the market penetration and the developed product because of its complexity.

On top of that, children tend to lose their interest in school due to the way that they are being taught. Children, most of the times, get standardized education that can’t fit to their needs, especially those that diverge from the average. Learning is primarily about memorizing. It focuses on the acquisition of information and it is a result of industrialization. Nowadays though, in the era of information, it is not possible for someone to keep up with the upcoming data. It is more important for the children to develop the soft skills that will help them to process information than memorize it. In the past decades, there have been no major blockbusters in educational software. Software focused on children, the demographic with the biggest claims on fun, are not getting it where they arguably need it most — in learning. We want to fil that gap by building the first educational software that parents, teachers and children will agree on.

Every child is going through an assessment just after the registration that gives us intelligence about the interests, competences knowledge gaps capabilities and preferable learning style of each user. Moreover, in Alexandria, all children can draw a different learning path, going through the seven different cognitive areas offered, corresponding to their needs since there is no linear approach in learning. Furthermore, we provide them a map of a customized rout based on their interests, weak and strong points while we combine that with a layer of an alive-evolving community and fun. The differentiation allows them to express and develop themselves while we force them to interact with their physical environment as well as with other children. On top of that, we use positive psychology to further engage them and parental control to make their journey safe. In this way we manage to keep the children in the flow of the game! ","Alexandria is a marketplace, with no direct competitors and in this case the first takes it all.

So far, the LePlan framework has been used in the field of Smart Homes/Smart Buildings, Marine Equipment solutions and Industrial automation.

The concept of LePlan is inspired by modern modular software engineering principles and global best practices. All electrical drawings are implemented as a combination of individual functions, which functions complete a system. Currently, the LePlan tool goes one step further and uses a combination of algorithms that automatically identify which functions or systems should be used to produce the required design and documentation.","Until today, designing any large project was a complex and resource-intensive process. LePlan provides an online and cloud-based solution, where users are asked to provide their project’s specifications. The data input takes place using dynamic forms that guide the engineer throughout the process. Dedicated forms are automatically generated for every specific business sector or product. 

Once the user submits the project’s specification form, the LePlan tool creates all required drawings, configuration files, and even the Quotation documents without any human interaction. Among others, the automatically generated deliverables include the Bill of Materials (BOMs), Cable & Connection Lists, System’s Overview, detailed drawings, panel views, and others.

LePlan’s tool has been developed, so that it can align with Vendors’ business models and follow the organization’s specific processes and deliverables format. Benefiting from custom software development helps to optimize existing businesses’ processes rather than replace them. Thus, our customers and their partners can incorporate our tool into their scope of practice. 

Drawings & Documentation benefit from a standardized structure allowing customers’ representatives to track devices easily during the whole lifecycle of the project. At the same time, engineers’ life becomes easier during procurement, assembly, testing, commissioning & support/troubleshooting of all systems.","Systems’ size and complexity grow at a staggering pace. For instance, in the construction industry, 10 years ago, a property’s control cabinet consisted of few circuit protection devices and switches. Today, the same property needs additional cabling for IT networks, safety & security systems, centralized audio and video distribution systems, electronic equipment to control lights, motorized blinds, and many more functions remotely and automatically. 

LePlan’s tool addresses the complexity like never before. It unifies the complete electrical, electronic, IT and IoT aspects of a project while it eliminates the manual design work. Only few seconds are needed to obtain the complete engineering study and documentation. 

LePlan expects to grow by a factor of 10 on a year-to-year basis for the next 3 years. As the process is automated (both technically & operationally) no growth bottlenecks are foreseen. Required CRM, server infrastructure and Project management tools are already in place","During the last 12 months, we have completed 18 projects and we have achieved upsell on 27% of our customers. More specifically, following several pilot projects in the UK, Cyprus, Greece, Germany, and Switzerland, LePlan secured its first high-value contract for a residential building in Glyfada/Greece. The project will be realized by a world-renowned Architecture office and owners awarded LePlan to fully design the Smart Home/Building functionality of the project. In addition, a rooftop in Kolonaki/Greece will be converted into an energy-efficient and fully automated property using LePlan’s services. 

In addition, LePlan currently has open deals/opportunities in various stages and is in negotiation with three major Smart Home Equipment makers (global brands) so that their equipment becomes part of the design process.

Having secured a contract in the maritime industry for the design of vessel-wide retrofit systems using OEM equipment, LePlan is highly active in the field of industrial automation and is in negotiations with three industrial automation system makers to fully automate their systems’ design process giving them a significant competitive advantage against their competitors.","LePlan currently targets large integrators (>200 projects per year) as well as Smart Home equipment and Industrial Automation system makers. Since Q4 2022, the LePlan solution has been exhibited at Dubai Big5 International Building & Construction Show and Barcelona IoT Solutions World Congress. Later in 2023, the LePlan tool will also be presented for the first time in the Local (Greek) market looking to expand LePlan’s presence in the local Hospitality and Construction industry (hotels, Airbnb, architecture, etc.).

The team consists of a managerial & technical lead with experience in scaling up a VC-funded Startup, a BDM with more than 20 years of Business Development and Sales experience, an operation manager with multidiscipline experience from highly regulated markets, and a marketing/content creator representative. The team has 1 PhD, 5 Masters and experts from 4 distinct academic & professional domains. At the same time, the team has a customer-centric and problem-solving attitude.","Following several years of self-funding the research and development efforts of the company, in 2023 LePlan will seek for 3rd party investment to scale up sales and address operational demand.",,,,,Bootstrapped,NA

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a strategic technology that allows digital automation development and offers significant benefits to businesses and society. 
Today, digital transformation using AI has been successfully implemented. Still, it remains a privilege of large companies mainly due to the need for specialized personnel in data science and data-driven marketing and the high cost of maintenance of computing resources and customized solutions. 
LIBRA AI technologies have proven, through large projects in Greece and abroad, that services and automation could be developed for SMEs based on the abundance of unused data already available in their online stores.
For full-filling this important gap, our company is creating suitable tools for small businesses easily and automatically integrated into their existing infrastructure. Their use does not require specialized personnel. It will improve their access to Information and Communication Technologies to monitor their profitability and customer satisfaction.","The pandemic emphasized the value of digital tools for the modernization of small and medium enterprises to their dynamic introduction into the digital market. Libra AI creates a new innovative product in MarTech (Marketing Technologies) that will give them access to opportunities that today are the prerogative only of large companies. It concerns the development of a self-service affordable AI-enabled platform accessible through simple subscription which provides 360o view of multichannel marketing campaigns’ performance, a crucial tool for in-house marketeers and small e-commerce companies owners to optimise their marketing campaigns and stand-out from the competition. 
The EMA (Explainable Marketing Analytics) platform will perform data analysis from online stores' sales, the automatic export of usable information on the client's characteristics, and the automatic optimization of actions to reduce their advertising costs, profitability, and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, it will be easily integrated into existing infrastructure, and its use will not require specialized personnel.","Our company will create an innovative product in Informatics, focusing mainly on the Marketing Technologies sector with significant benefits for the company and small businesses in Greece and abroad. Based on the goal of the project, its results are expected to contribute:
1. In the production of innovative AI tools for small businesses to enhance their competitiveness through the use of e-commerce, especially at this time during the COVID-19 pandemic
2. In the production of new knowledge about machine learning algorithms and AI models around online store data utilization to increase turnover.
3. The creation of new jobs for specialized scientists, both during the project and afterward (2 new engineers) for the company itself and dozens of new jobs that will arise in the cooperating companies through the development of their online stores.
The company's competitiveness introduces a new innovative product in the European market and a highly dynamic sector. Typically, the size of this market amounts to 450 million euros in Europe per year. It is worth noting that in Greece, there is no similar competitive product. At the same time, at the European level, the competition is limited, and there is a possibility of development and expansion.
We aim to create a complete product placed on the market immediately and fill a large gap by creating a suite of tools aimed at small businesses, which did not have this possibility.
","Libra AI technologies already have many customers in the Greek market. Our company offers custom AI-enabled marketing analytics and business intelligence. Furthermore, it offers applied advanced AI and machine learning in real-life applications. Indicatively, We have developed the business intelligence and e-commerce analytics framework of Coffee Island. Moreover, we have contributed to the design and execution of the information retrieval in court decisions machine learning challenge organized by the National Bank of Greece.

Our difference comes from the fact that when employees DO NOT engage with the apps functions, it gives the HR department the initiative to talk with management leaders and address this at hand. So basically we reinvent the HR communication system and philosophy.","According to Gallup, more than 85% of employees in major corporations are completely disengaged. Typically, only 15% of employees love their job, while another 15% are dissatisfied for various reasons. The remaining 70% of employees are simply going through the motions to get through the day. This results in significant losses, amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars in the US and seven trillion dollars worldwide due to employees only doing the bare minimum and not satisfying customers.

However, we can address this issue by providing appropriate engagement tools at the right time. This can reduce the number of employees who are just doing their job to 55%, resulting in a more engaged workforce that interacts more positively with customers. This approach is so well-established that projections suggest that companies will spend nearly $2 billion annually on engagement solutions within the next five years.

Our solution is a completely modular system based on SAAS, and we offer fully customized white label platforms as well. The modular system includes internal communications, workgroups, operational productivity, employee engagement, and HR management, all within a single, comprehensive platform. With no hidden costs and less anxiety, we offer a one-stop solution to increase employee engagement and productivity","Over the past few years, we have achieved significant benefits by welcoming over 4,500 users from five different countries and languages onto our platform. The managers who use our platform are very pleased with it, and it has been proven to enhance productivity while reducing the turnover rate of our best staff members. Our approach is expected to enable us to reach Break Even in just two years once the scaling process begins.

At the same time, responsible stakeholders have already started imposing heavy regulations and auditing policies (e.g. AIAct) towards the protection of individuals’ privacy and the delivery of explainable AI solutions. In other words, digital services analysing medical data relying on AI technology must be capable of providing adequate explanation of the machine’s prediction. 

The discussion on the emerging Web3.0 ecosystem is mainly focusing on how to securely store and share data and less on the operations on top of them.

In brief, the problem we are tacking is to enable the designing, building and deployment of scalable ML apps related to the handling of critical data, fast, compliant with the required regulations both on cloud and on the edge.","Data analysis is actually a pipeline of well-defined tasks, delivered by a related stakeholder that wishes to execute a collection of operations on a resource that is owned by another stakeholder.

Our platform offers a webapp, that a data scientist can clearly define the appropriate script that upon executed will deliver the requested result (i.e. trained model or prediction) and then, share it with the data owners. The latter, via the platform can utilize a graphical interface where the agreed data inputs are shown and grant access to the data they have. Then, they execute the analysis script and deliver the output to the last part of the equation (i.e. the one getting the actual value).

Our platform can be considered as a middleware that controls the ML operations automatically routing execution to instructed resources on the cloud (public, private, on-premises) or on the edge and scaling up accordingly, delivering smoothly the outcome of the ML app execution to the end user.","Federated Machine Learning (ML) is a concept introduced by Google a couple of years ago to tackle the basic issue of data analysis and privacy protection. A revolutionized solution that allows handling sensitive data. In addition, no code/Low code tools have been around for long in the software industry. The past 2-3 years this trend is more and more used in the AI world for allowing efficient collaboration between data analysis teams. 

The innovative feature of our solution is that our platform is augmenting the concept of federated ML by adding the aspect of compliance and sandbox execution combining both on the cloud and/or on the edge deployment. Furthermore, the way the platform is built allows for the establishment of data analysis based on smart contract output validation, a feature that is also differentiates our product from competitors. Although similar cases have been introduced, our platform differentiates in the fact that by its design offers a flexible and trustworthy data analysis execution and proof of valid analysis upon which the various payments shall be cleared (as an escrow payment system for validated data analysis services).","Although the company has established quite recently a few important milestones have been achieved. We believe that the best investor is the client of the service, thus, we have secured two contracts with local clients to run two pilot cases. The first contract is related to the quality inspection of the production line (on edge deployment of the platform), while the second to deploy the platform as a black box to deliver a Data-Science-as-a-Service solution (on-premises installation).

Current TRL:3-4. With the two client funded pilots we wish to validate the core product with the end users. Per our current product roadmap, we aim to reach TRL7 the next 12-16 months.

Many labor hours plus lack of timely information about network's current status add up a huge cost to the overall procedure.
Various industries in electricity, gas and water distribution management try to deal with this issue. Our company is developing a device capable of eliminating this problem.","We design and develop an add-on device that retrofits existing analogue meters transforming them to IoT (Internet of Things) devices. 
Hence, there will be no need for manual data logging or human intervention in the process of metering. Also due to well-timed information, leakages can be detected faster thus minimizing losses and potential threats.
Our device uses a camera to capture a photo of the readings, uses AI (Artificial Intelligence) software to convert the readings to digital data and uploads them real-time to a cloud server via a specialized low power wide area network. 
All the components of the device are designed in a way which maximizes battery life span to approximately 10 years.","Our product uses state of the art technologies.  The specialized camera which takes the photo, the AI algorithm that recognizes the numbers and converts them to data and, the utilization of a low power wide area network protocol  for the data trasmission, prove the innovative characteristics of our solution. Our key differentiator is the ability of our device to trasmit data wirelessly in real time without the need of human intervention. Currently, there is no other solution in the market hosting this feature.

Our focus will be on public and private sector organizations, managing distribution networks, as well as various municipalities in Greece. Our product can also be oriented to other energy networks (natural gas, electricity) and be promoted in foreign markets that adopt smart digital solutions to measure and monitor networks. The communication protocols of IoT devices are international, so all that is left is the translation and parameterization of the system based on the respective implementation body. ","Since the creation MCI IKE two major accomplishments have been met. Our first accomplishment is the successful deal with VENETIS ABEET, a major player in the food and catering industry, installing our retail software to over 100 of the companys 120 stores and canteens, with more than 400 counters in total. Our retail software covers all the essential needs of an SME (Small-Medium Enterprise)  from cashier and back-office operations to procedures such as exchange of data and information like price lists, new product catalogues, sales figures with the Headquarters.
Our second achievement was the signing of a contract with the biggest water management and supply organization in Greece, to provide them the PDAs and develop the software needed for the data logging of the water meters. Up until today, more than 1 million bills are carried out every month based on our software. ","Andreas Vlachos is the founder of MCI IKE.

Q&Q aspires of a future where current user interaction devices, like joysticks in the extended reality(XR), will be replaced by a more intuitive one, entirely revolutionizing the interaction framework, providing an appreciably higher User Experience (UX) outcome. Its main focus and activity concerns the commercialization of MAGOS (patent pending (PCT/EP20200/73034) solution. 
Q&Q is multiple award winning startup: EIT health, XR4ALL, Trinity, Weld Galaxy, RIMA, SmartEEs2, DigiFED 
and has been selected by Invest Horizon, Startup3 & Mass Challenge 2021 (Houston) accelerators.","Q&Q offers its MAGOS Platform, a combination of Hardware(HW) & Software(SW), an immersive Human Machine Interface (HMI).  

Via this Platform an end user can interact with a virtual environment using her/ his fingers, tackling the technology limitations that restrict the physical touch interaction in eXtended Reality(XR). It uses a combination of IoT technologies, innovative mechanical and electrical design(the MAGOS Glove) & intelligent SW, to perform activities like pilot training or medical training enabling the digital transformation of the training procedures across multiple sectors.

Magos, the next gen human-computer-interaction(HCI) solution, is coming to revolutionize the interaction framework in the XR. A solution that enables freedom of fingers movement has an important role to play. It is an essential aid especially for virtual simulations and training applications which prepare individuals to work and perform in highly demanding and stressful environments. Imagine that you could interact with every button in a virtual cockpit using your fingers instead of holding a pair of touch controllers or have a doctor to be trained in surgical procedure within a virtual operating room, at a medical university.  

The unique capabilities of Magos enable the development of training applications that can offer the muscle memory required to efficiently and accurately perform complex procedures, having a more intuitive, immersive and realistic interaction with the virtual world","Most of us have had an eXtended reality (XR) experience at some point and would agree that in most cases this experience is delivered by almost three of our senses – visual, audio and ‘somehow’ the touch sense. 

The limitations for sensation of touch in XR are clear. Let’s consider the extensively-used touch controllers which deliver life-like hand presence and enable basic interactions in the VR environment. These touch controllers try to simulate the touch sense, blocking natural interaction via fingers. And when it comes to doing things in a natural way, nothing can compete with the human hand. As a result, the users are unable to interact naturally as they would in the real world, something that significantly affects the overall user experience (UX) and especially the virtual training and simulation applications. 

Based on the studies and reports of high-profile organizations, the sense of touch in XR has not yet reached the desired level. The immersive technologies market is looking for solutions to enhance the immersion, e.g., head mounted display comfortability, haptics and peripherals, tracking systems. There are several components and functions whose improvement will benefit the XR ecosystem. However, there is one, the interaction via the user’s fingers, whose role is of major importance for XR to be more widely adopted. ","MAGOS project is highly innovative and has attracted the interest by leading large global corporates (SIEMENS, PHILIPS, THALES). The goal is to drive such organizations to digitally transform their procedures via Magos platform. The added value is the introduction of a high-end tech solution via the UK establishment and the creation of high skilled working positions.

We are a team of seven professionals with complementary backgrounds in extended reality (XR), hardware and software development, industrial design, robotics, marketing, project management and business development.
All key competitors are grouped into four categories   based on the technology (Inertial Measurement Units, Electromagnetic, Optical and Stretch) they use for tracking. All of them are unable to provide reliable data due to their technology limitations. 
The major problem in Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) solutions is the error accumulation, in electromagnetic is the interference by  external environments, in wireless is the occlusion effect (imagine you place one hand below the other there is no tracking) and lastly, in stretch the usual problem is the erroneous data due to fitting constraints.
Magos introduces a totally new approach that does not just overcome the existing technology drawbacks but enhances the performance of additional subsystems such as haptic and force feedback.","Our leading team is seeking for an investment close to 1.9 million euros, with witch it aims to reach during 1,5 year period the mass production phase.

In past seasons wages of inactive players from injuries were €250 million in Premier League, €312 million in NBA, and €1.3 billion in MLB. Evidently, sports science has become a huge part of the industry today. Apart from direct costs such as salaries of inactive players, medical practitioners, sports physicians, and potential hospitalization, there are also societal costs like insurance costs and social costs related to the burden of psychological trauma. 70% of the injuries are no-contact, wear injuries that could have been predicted. Another important aspect is the increase of sports-related injuries of the youth population, either on amateur or competitive levels.
Medinevo offers a biomechanical injury prevention tool for professional athletes who often experience muscle injuries. Medinevo's product purpose is to prevent injuries and facilitate the rehabilitation process. The accompanying software product assists experts in predicting injuries in athletes with high accuracy, providing information such as 3D visualization, topology, muscle condition and potential injury index for each individual athlete.
","Medinevo offers the 1st injury prevention solution for high performing athletes based on personalized bio-engineering analysis. Its novelty is based on a unique approach combining cutting-edge advancements in the fields of biomechanics, medical science, AI, data science and computational engineering. The product is designed with the purpose to predict and prevent non-contact soft-tissue injuries and to monitor muscle strain for each athlete so that the training program can be adapted to maximize performance. The required inputs for each athlete are a once-off MRI scan and his/her daily GPS tracking data. A personalized 3D digital twin is constructed based on the geometry from the MRI & GPS data are converted into ‘‘bioengineering’’ input through a series of AI modules. Via a Muscle Mechanical Simulation Model, personalized stress-strain profiles are generated with injury risk thresholds. A 3D visualization of the muscles is provided, tracking the areas of maximum load concentration and risk of failure.","Medinevo’s solution moves ahead of the curve of its industry, making a breakthrough in monitoring athletes’ muscle strain and, thus, preventing sports injuries. It is the first time that monitoring of training load goes beyond the sole employment of statistical and AI methods to detect patterns. In detail, up to today, solutions for injury prevention rely on the capturing of patterns relating workload intensity with past injury occurrences, without any reference to the specific mechanism involved or without indicating the type of injury predicted. Medinevo’s solution is providing unprecedented insight in the muscles’ condition of each athlete separately, offering both injury risk assessments based on personalized muscle-specific stress-strain behavior profiles as well as 3D visualization with localization of areas in risk. The offered solution is per se scalable as it relies on the establishment of an algorithmic process based on biomechanical concepts and the application of ANN solutions. Two factors are further defining the scalability; first the processing of the MRI images which is planned to be automated and second the utilization of additional resources to provide cloud capacity when requests loads grow. Medinevo’s plan is to have 3 European Football Clubs as early adopters in 2021 and 16 clubs in the early maturity stage (2022). In 2023, Medinevo will expand in markets outside Europe, starting with North America and Asia in 2023. ","2019: June: Medinevo was admitted to the EGG (Enter-Grow-Go) programme accelerator for start-ups, a Eurobank CSR Initiative. Dr. Papakostas, then Head of Medical at PAOK F.C. and now at Orthopaedic Surgeon at Aspetar Sports Medicine Hospital, joined the Team as a CMO.

Casting procedure is a time consuming and messy process for the doctors. The casts cannot be reused and although their price is low the required time for the overall treatment and healing process of the patient is high. Right now thermoplastic solutions are only being used for rehabilitation purposes.
2nd Product - Bracing is currently the primary method for treating moderate idiopathic scoliosis (IS) during the developmental phase of growth. Accurate evaluation of patient compliance with scoliosis brace usage has been a challenge for physicians treating patients with IS. This inability to accurately measure compliance has resulted in difficulty in determining brace treatment efficacy.","1st Product - Splints for fractures
AidPlex’s splints are a lightweight alternative that can be used for fractures and rehabilitation, thus extending significantly the applicability of the proposed solution. AidPlex’s splints are ready for use anytime needed. 
How it works
Unlike common casts and splints, AidPlex splint is a thermoplastic splint that is ready for use anytime needed. The heating procedure takes only 2 minutes with a thermogun or hot water and the application of the splint 5 minutes, making the procedure of splinting much faster. 

2nd Product - System for Monitoring of Scoliosis
AidPlex is offering a smart wearable device for monitoring scoliosis of patients treatment with a patient management system for clinicians. Patients through this telehealth system will wear their backbrace for the prescribed time and this can lead to better curve correction at the end of the treatment while decreasing the possibility of having a spinal surgery.","1st Product - Splints for fractures
Splits are not custom-made, but they can fit the unique skeletal characteristics of the patient’s injured body part. This feature saves significant time spent by doctors and nurses which could be used more efficiently. With AidPlex, healthcare professionals reduce their costs and limit their inefficiencies, whilst patients are provided with an excellent quality splint. Finally, AidPlex’s splints are designed to be part of the circular economy framework, as they are based on recyclable and biodegradable materials.

2nd Product - System for Monitoring of Scoliosis
Patients through this telehealth system will wear the backbrace for the prescribed time and this can lead to better curve correction at the end of the treatment while increasing the possibility of avoiding spinal surgery.
Gamification also improves their quality of life, while making the treatment a more pleasant experience. They feel responsible about their treatment outcome and that they are in control of it. Patients’ family will be assured that the prescribed treatment for their child will have the expected outcome. Following with clinicians, they have a better overview about their patients’ progress and compliance. Having a 24/7 data feed for the patients, they can determine the outcome of the treatment before having a predetermined appointment (e.g. appointment every six months).","For the past two years, AidPlex has raised a total of 150,000€ non-dilutive funding from 2 EC Grants (iProduce Grant- H2020, Proof of Concept Grant from Patras Science Park) and 1 grant from The People\'s Trust.

In addition, AidPlex was the winner of several startup competitions (MIT Enterprise Forum Greece 2019, Mindspace Challenge 2018, Ennovation, Startup Weekend Kavalas, EcoCity Forum by AZK).

Until now, AidPlex has Researched and Developed two medical devices, which are projected to enter the EU market by 2022.
AidPlex\'s first product is an eco-friendly, reusable and recyclable thermoplastic splint for fractures. An observational study will be rolled out by the end of 2020 and AidPlex Splint will be ready for market launch, targeting EU5 & US, starting from Greece and Cyprus as test markets. 
In the previous two years, AidPlex has acquired CE mark and has also filed a Full patent (US20200009288A1) & a PCT application (WO2020008253A1) to the USPTO and WIPO.","AidPlex was founded by Harry Yeremtzes and Dimitris Moustakas 2 years ago and is operating in Thessaloniki, Greece. It has opened 3 jobs for engineers and also provided paid internship opportunities for three students of Greek Universities. One of those interns was hired one year ago and became the CTO of AidPlex. Now the core team consists of 5 Engineers, 3 Business Advisors and 2 Scientific-Medical Advisors. As a greek startup AidPlex is focusing on international markets for commercializing its products but operating in Greece, helping in that way the local ecosystem of startups grow but also helping the economy of Greece rise. 
AidPlex team is confident that the commercialization will first focus on the EU and USA due to lower barriers to entry. Once CE-mark is achieved, commercialization will start from Greece and Cyprus, as test markets (2022). After achieving first paying customers, AidPlex is going to start operations in EU5. At the same time, AidPlex will start the FDA process for future expansion in the US.

So, the travelers were forced to find accommodation to more remote locations for their short stay such as the center of Athens. Αs a result they wasted valuable time from the minimum they had until the next flight or the next ship, or they had to settle for low quality airbnb accommodations of the area near the airport.
Our goal is to ensure an easy and relaxing short stay of the visitor from the moment of arrival at the airport until his departure for the next destination.
","Therefore, Airstay adapted all its services in order to provide cozy, spacious and comfortable apartments near Athens airport (10 mins maximum distance by car) combining the quality of accommodation with the quality of transport service, making our guests feel safe for their transportation from and to the airport as soon as possible. Our customers can make reservations and book our services online. They can immediately after booking, receive an automated message with all the necessary information about their accommodation and the electronic locks' passwords for their entrance to the apartment, as well as make a transfer reservation through our site and within 15 minutes after booking our company's means of transport will arrive at the airport to pick up the customer.","Between city's fast-paced lifestyle, the unexpected delays or the long waiting time at the Airport, our company innovates by offering with one click all the services that the stopover customer may need. Our company can immediately and quickly serve a traveler who has already landed at the airport and has not made a reservation yet. Through our website, the interested party can choose one of our accommodations, and request a transfer service. Upon confirmation of the reservation the customer receives the passwords as well as useful information about the accommodation. In the next minutes the mean of transport picks up the customer and transports him to the accommodation. During the short ride to the accommodation, the customer can make a reservation for his next transfer back to the Airport or any other destination. 
In the first year of the company's operation, we aimed to create an ideal service model for stopover customers. A significant barrier appears to be the amount of the accommodations provided by individuals due to low cost and inadequate services. The consistency of our services and the feeling of security were the key elements that made customers trust Airstay repeatedly. Today, all of us at Airstay believe that our model is more than a simple accommodation service and it can be expanded to other busy international airports that connection flights apart a big percentage of the total passenger's traffic.
","Our company was founded in 2018 and had 9 accommodations under its management. In 2019, the company's accommodation increased to 30. In 2020 we moved our headquarters to Spata and created new offices. Also in 2020, our website and our platform of online bookings were created. In 2019 the average occupancy of our accommodations was 80% with an average stay of 1.3 days per reservation, resulting in more than 18,000 different guests with more than 8,500 overnight stays. The low average stay makes the procedures quite difficult to manage. That is why we are constantly investing in technology, automating processes that enabling us to grow rapidly.","The Airstay team having a common vision and guidelines consists of young people from different professional sectors, whose combination gives a total solution to a significant market need. An economist, a business manager, an environmental scientist, a property valuer and an architect each having their own experience and working together. Airstay created a team that is distinguished by respect, passion for work and love for Greece and the place where they grew up. This team doesn’t stop evolving and helping in development of the area around the Ath Airport, giving guests a taste of hospitality in a modern way. ","The next steps for Airstay are to: 
-Renovate the existing apartments by creating a uniformity, which is important for the guests who travel constantly.
-Increase the number of our accommodation by following the same architectural style and providing the same facilities and services in all of them.
-Incorporate more services in the short term accommodation, evolve the transfer service and any other services that could be useful to a short-term traveler.
-Develop our website to a tailor made one and develop an application that can meet all the requests of a demanding and low on time traveler. (par ex. make the booking procedure of the transfer service more simple, the guests will be able to watch through our website or app how fast our vehicle will be at the airport to pick them by showing through our app the real time location of the vehicle).
-One more important need is the promotion and advertising to reach our target group -the business travelers- as we see that it’s a crowd that uses International airports very often and they can repeatedly book an accommodation from a specific company if they find out that they have everything they need on a value for money price.

In many indoor spaces there is a lot of pollution, at least 2 to 5 times more, compared to outside because of the materials we use that release toxic gases and of course are not ecofriendly. 
One other problem is that every year the municipalities in Greece pay a lot of money to throw huge amounts of seagrass into the landfills. 
Instead of being a huge cost, seagrass for us is a huge resource. By using only the dried seagrass as raw material, for our eco surfaces, we reduce the volume of waste in landfills, and at the same time, we contribute to recycling and the circular economy. 
Metis Seagrass eco surfaces are made using an innovative and unique way of repurposing a sustainable material.

","Metis Seagrass creates natural fibre-based eco surfaces made from the dried seagrass, Posidonia Oceanica, and biological binders, for use in indoor spaces to provide a healthier alternative to traditional materials and improve indoor pollution.  We aim to inspire the growing popularity of using renewable materials by providing eco surfaces that combine a minimal carbon footprint with contemporary design.  Metis Seagrass eco surfaces offer a viable alternative to traditional petrochemical and non-ecological panels and surfaces, the main culprits of indoor pollution. 
We have achieved during production: no water used, zero waste, and minimumuse of energy. 
Metis Seagrass follows the Circular Economy principles. Seagrass has healthy properties. It is antifungal, antibacterial, anti-allergenic and it has insulation properties (like thermal and acoustic) and it is a very lightweight material.  These positive attributes give it an advantage over other surfaces. We have developed a variety of different surfaces to expand their application and are fully customisable to provide freedom for designers and to adapt to market requirements.","Metis Seagrass eco surfaces are made using an innovative and unique way of repurposing a sustainable material.

Seagrass has healthy properties (antifungal, antibacterial, anti-allergenic), insulation properties (thermal and acoustic), and is a lightweight material. These positive attributes give it an advantage over other surfaces. Therefore we have created products that take advantage of these properties. The seagrass Surfaces are characterised by their naturalness, authenticity and are fully customisable. We provide a variety of colours using natural pigments and we work closely with our clients for colour matching.
We can use different substrates based on customer projects. 
Recently, we developed flexible fabric, paper-based and self-adhesive paper surfaces that are lightweight and easy to apply. This way we expand their applications to more markets.

The spin-off company will be called «MINDS TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES PRIVATE COMPANY» with abbreviated name «MINDS PC» (where MINDS means “MARINE INNOVATION, DEPOLLUTION & SERVICES”).
The shareholders of MINDS are HCMR scientists (54.85%), HCMR (5.40%), the company New Naval (NNL - 23.70%) and the company KOSMOS INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND SERVICES Private Company (KISS Intelligence - 16.05%).
The main purposes of MINDS include:
1. Design and implementation of integrated solutions for the protection of aquatic ecosystems (marine and inland waters) from pollution, with emphasis on the collection of plastics (macro and microplastics).
2. The development, production, selling and exploitation of collection products and waste containment and filtration devices in aquatic ecosystems (marine and inland waters), utilizing already produced prototypes.
MINDS will utilize, improve / upgrade / evolve and develop new techniques, methodologies and products - services related to the protection of aquatic ecosystems (marine and inland waters) from pollution, with emphasis on plastic and marine litter collection technologies such as the CLEAN TRASH system.
","The innovative floating boom (floating barrier- CLEAN TRASH® - CLAIM’s Litter Entrapping Autonomous Network Tactical Recovery Accumulation System Hellas -system) retains, collects and monitors floating litter (that include macroplastics), specifically devised to operate in river mouths and waterways, reached a TRL 9. This highly-efficient solution manages to collect and sustain litter and macroplastics at river mouths before entering into the open sea and affecting the marine ecosystem. The scale model was built at New Naval’s facility in Lavrio, Greece, in late 2018 and a prototype was deployed at the river mouth of Kifissos river in Athens, Greece in 2019, where it was possible to estimate that the system may capture about 95-97% of macrolitter (> 5 mm). The effectiveness and capabilities of the system passed all quality assurance testing, confirming that the system is ready to be installed in active, long-term operational environments. It can continuously retain and remove marine litter from river mouths and be a commercial product purchased by authorities and all stakeholders related to marine litter pollution.","The CLEAN TRASH® system utilizes a combination of active, advanced operational systems and time-tested oil spill response, salvage and marine protection equipment:
• Heavy-duty containment boom with solid cylindrical floats with a subsurface skirt contains and guides litter.
• Auxiliary fence type booms drive/deflect/pace incoming litter to the collection cage.
• A floating foundation attaches to the boom and holds the removable collection cage.
• The hot-dipped galvanized steel collection cage utilizes 3 separate collection chambers/levels that lower and raise to store the litter (down to 5 mm in size). The cage is equipped with lifting points and a sliding door.
• Independent floats utilize salvage technology to move the storage level. They can be raised and lowered by satellite when a level is filled.
• Remote operation and observation versions are available with the development of standalone models optional.

Every installation is tailor-made and strategically planned in order for the system to operate with the highest efficiency and effectiveness while addressing the scale of the issue:
• System components are custom-built, designed to properly address the environment, location and river of every installation.
• The system can be continuously operated, monitored and utilized to collect and compile a litter information database regarding the volume of litter exiting the river and the correlations of these volumes to weather and river fluctuations.
","The system is an unparalleled and highly-efficient solution to manually managing and removing marine litter from river mouths before the litter can enter into a larger body of water where the litter can cause negative effects on the marine environments and where plastics can break into micro and macro-plastics dramatically affecting marine life and marine ecosystems. The system has a highly efficient storage design with multiple levels that can be remotely interchanged when filled.
During a systematic 38 days demonstration period of the CLEAN TRASH® system, macro-plastics collected have been quantified and categorized in terms of material type and size, in order to verify the CLEAN TRASH® ability in terms of litter removal. The in situ field-testing of the technology was demonstrated at the Kifissos river estuary (Piraeus, Greece). Within 38 days, a total of 1175 kg of litter was removed during the successful installation at the mouth of the river. The percentage of plastic litter found at the Kifissos river (68-79%) is in line with previous studies on litter collection in another EU river (Rhone river), where plastics represented 77% of the identified items by using the visual observations. These first findings support the potential of this system to be applied in rivers in other geographic areas, thereby increasing our knowledge on macrolitter collection in the river estuaries, before the litter to end up in the sea.
","The human capital of MINDS consists of a combination of enthusiastic individuals from various backgrounds and some of the most experienced Scientists and Experts in oceanography and depollution. Qualified Oceanographers, Marine Engineers, Software and IT Engineers and Experts that share a passion for the marine environment and its protection form an ideal mixture of people who are willing to support and deliver solutions for plastic collection technologies from the aquatic environment, depollution services, modelling of pollutants dispersion and transport.
Our customers include:
•Public Authorities (ministries, municipalities, river management authorities).  
•Private organizations (port authorities, port reception facilities, waste management contractors etc). 
•Tourism operators (hotels, private beaches, resorts, marinas).
Our sales channels include:

•Sales with after-sales services: System offered as a Product and additional maintenance and repair services with additional fees.
•Servicization: System offered as a Service on an access-based approach with a Servicization business model (Leasing/Rental).
","We want first to focus in Mediterranean countries focusing in 40 rivers that are responsible for 85% of the pollution and then at 80 more achieving 92% reduction in the annual flows of plastics in the Mediterranean Sea.
Post COVID-19 pandemic waste increase from gloves, masks and personal protective equipment will result in increased demand for solutions.
We are seeking for Business partnerships and further capital increase in order to penetrate additional global markets. 
We are planning further advancement of automation, remote control technology, green energy resources (solar, wind or hydro power) and land operations for easier removal and transfer ashore.
We therefore request €2.600.000 capital investment for:
•Studies and model software for the positioning and hotspot identification (200,000 €).

Despite the fact that Public-use Heavy Duty Vehicles (waste collection, trucks, lorries, cranes etc.) represent the 5% of vehicles, they contribute to the 33% of the emissions produced within urban centers due to their outdated emission control technology. Given their low levels of fatigue  they may remain in circulation even up to 22 years given the high cost associated to their replacement (above 150,000€). Thus, the circulation of technologically obsolete Heavy Duty Vehicles (even Euro I) adversely affect the cities’ quality of atmosphere throughout Europe. It is indicative that in 2016 the concentration of carcinogenic benzene at Patission Station (according to the atmospheric pollution measurements of the Ministry of Environment) returned to the levels of 2006 by 2016, while it had been previously reduced by 50%.
","MNLT brings into the market Innovative Catalyst Based Emission Control Systems for Heavy Duty Vehicles, which will significantly impact the environment, dramatically reducing GHGs nd air pollutant emissions. This will allow for their adherence to the requirement standards set by the EU for air quality and emissions levels. The reduction in toxic emissions can be achieved by the use of nanotechnology for the production of multi-metallic catalytic substrates. During the last yeats, this innovative catalytic technology has ben demonstrated (in real conditions) on 10 vehicles of the Municipality of Galatsi (Greece). These 10 vehicles have been upgraded as per the European emissions measuring system from EURO IV to EURO VI. It has been estimated that the specific upgrade of the heavy vehicles will result in 95% reduction of the main toxic emissions.

","The main innovations of MNLT's product are: a) The utilization of Copper Nanoparticles in the catalyst of HDVs instead of Platinum Group Metals which results to the reduction of the cost while at the same time secures the supply of PGMs which faces huge problems in the last years. On the contrary, the existing solutions neccesitate additional PGMs to achieve the required emission control which increases the final cost. b) The exisiting solutions that fulfill the emissions control standards do not achieve reduction of NO2 at low temperatures which occurs in urban areas,while MNLT's innovation achieves a
99,7 reduction of NOx.
MNLT aims to become a major key player/manufacturer of catalytic converters to the EU HDVs. For an initial annual production of 13,000 autocatalysts, an investment of 5 Million Euro is expected which will bring an increase in revenues of the level of 1 Million Euro per year, while in order to create a 5% share of the total HDVs catalyst market, it is required an investment of at least 15 Million euro.
The two main barriers for the growth potential are:
1) The high amount of investment that is needed due to the fact that the company is small. Even if the innovation is high and has a great potential for application, it is difficult to convince investors and attract a high amount of budget from VCs or other sources.
2) The second barrier aims to the already established market, dominated by few key manufacturers, which seems very difficult to penetrate.
","The proposed system has already been developed and validated in medium scale (TRL 7), while similar technology has been patented and applied in passenger cars with sucess. In the passenger cars case a substitution of up to 67% of the PGMs used in automotive catalysts has been achived, while maintaining their performance and durability at high levels. The proposed catalyst based emission control device for HDVs has currently reached TRL 7 and is validated in real life trucks. The successful validation will constitute the major milestone for the production process and the company. Upon achieving this, next steps include the further development of the product and customisation of the technology to serve different types of vehicles (e.g. ships, trucks, buses, etc.) and brands/models. This will be the next milestone for the process which will bring the product at TRL 9 (commercial product). The overall target is to make a universal emission control system serving all different HDVs needs.

There are two cases of creating revenues on the specific innovation. The one aims to the manufacturing/production and direct selling the innovative catalyst for the HDVs which is the initial target of the company. This can bring an extreme growth on MNLT since over a 10 year projection timeframe it can reach revenues of 45,4 Million Euro with an NPV of 34 Million Euro and IRR of 73%. However this case neccesitates an initial investment of at least 15 Million Euro in order to set-up a large production unit that can cover a small
percentage (ca. 5%) of the existing HDVs in Europe intially. The second case aims to the patent sharing and to the creation of revenues of selling the IPs in interested large industries. Based on the fact that the idea involves a high level innovation, there is a chance of selling the whole idea to an existing producer which will adopt the idea of MNLT in the production line.",,,,,Seed,664046

Our focus lies on the development of the first perioperative integrated clinical decision-support platform aiming at assisting clinicians at all phases of a surgical intervention. We start from the patient triaging and at high-risk patient detection preoperatively with the use of smart medical-grade wearables. During the surgical operation, our explainable AI algorithms support anaesthesiologists in their decision-making by generating predictions of potential complication that may occur. Finally, patients admitted to the general ward after the operation, are continuously monitored for postoperative complications with the use of our non-invasive medical wrist-wearables.","Leveraging recent advances in perioperative informatics, we present Aisthesis, an AI-driven SaMD that supports anesthesiologists and intensivists by predicting adverse perioperative complications. Using real-time data we are developing a ML-based system able to predict real-time hemodynamic and other risks and present an explanation of factors contributing to that risk during the whole perioperative treatment phase. This informed risk prediction enables anesthesiologists to plan an appropriate course of action to avoid such risks. Our system will improve patient safety and quality of care by providing clinical decision support and timely clinical feedback via post-hoc reports. Such improved documentation will lead to accurate capture of intraoperative data and will enhance legal fortification due to unbiased, precise records. Finally, hospitals can benefit from a reduced length of stay (LOS) since we can decrease the LOS cost up to 55% by integrating our solution.","Our solution we suggest comes with a user-friendly mobile UI that can be easily learned by anaesthesiologists and does not interfere with the surgical workflow. In addition, it can be integrated into any medical monitoring equipment already available on the market. Moreover, the anesthesiologist has access to real-time predictions for potential complications during the surgical operation. This will lead to faster, more accurate, and more efficient decision-making prior to any unwanted situation. Aisthesis Medical addresses the Anaesthesia Monitoring Devices Market that, as reported in a 2022 study, is valued at approximately USD 1,6 billion at a global level in 2021 and is anticipated to grow with a growth rate of more than 12% for the period 2022-2028. Main drivers in this case as well are considered the aging population and the growing number of surgeries. Our company aims at scaling up within the Greek ecosystem taking advantage of both the human and financial resources available. We will thus open new positions to exceptional researchers and professionals in Greece since we firmly believe that they can advance our vision based on their intellectual spirit.
","So far, we have completed the first prototype of our clinical decision-support system demonstrating the clinical added value through extensive post-hoc validation. Moving forward, Aisthesis Medical is slowly but steadily gaining recognition from multiple stakeholders. This is becoming more and more obvious in the past few months. The stakeholders’ list provided below is solely on an indicative base and is by no means complete. We can classify them as:
1. Healthcare Partners: Esteemed institutions from advanced healthcare markets, such as the General University Hospital of Larisa (Greece), the Regensburg University Hospital (Germany) and the University Hospital of Frankfurt (Germany) have not only shown active interest in providing us with data to further advance our Machine Learning algorithms, but they believe in the scientific case of our platform.
2. Potential Collaborators: Individuals of high calibre have shown interest in a potential collaboration with Aisthesis Medical. A notable example is Prof. Dr. Herwig Gerlach (Klinik für Anästhesie, Vivantes Klinikum Neukolln).
3. Various start-up competitions, programs, etc. As an example, we have just been selected to participate in the EIT Health SymbIASIS program to explore potential collaborations with Greek hospitals.
4. Supported by top-notch technical corporates like Microsoft for Startups, NVIDIA Inception program as well as AWS Activate.

","Our team is comprised of experienced engineers in the field of Biomedical Engineering and AI. Especially, the cofounders work in the field of healthcare informatics and have more than 6 years of experience in building clinical decision-support systems in the clinical setting. The team is also accompanied by a specialist anesthesiologist and an expert in business management, company growth and investment strategy. Sharing a passion for medical technology and having a vision to assist clinicians to provide excellent care to their patients, we ended up with the concept of an integrated clinical decision-support platform towards proactive and preventive perioperative care. We are always open for highly motivated and highly skilled scientists/engineers to join our efforts.","Aisthesis Medical plans to secure an initial funding of €250,000 that will take us up to, and including, the MVP implementation and integration in a hospital setting. After having achieved that, we will try to secure a further funding for the CE and MDR certifications of our SaMD clinical decision-support system.",,,,"[{'title': 'P4 Precision Medicine accelerator', 'year': '2022', 'type': 'Program'}, {'title': 'The EGG accelerator', 'year': '2021', 'type': 'Program'}, {'title': 'ACEin accelerator', 'year': '2021', 'type': 'Program'}, {'title': 'Life Sciences accelerator', 'year': '2021', 'type': 'Program'}]",Bootstrapped,NA

Decision of purchase is usually made one time while frequence of purchase may be 1 or even 2 times per month at some cases for a lifetime period (up to 14 years) (large breed dogs, many pets, etc.). Moreover, dry pet food usually weights above 5kg per bag (usually around 15kg for a medium sized-dog) and it is a hussle to carry it around from the pet store.

The following problems are real issues that the provider itself faced daily and solved by creating moralius platform.
1.    The customers of FM providers tend to consolidate all FM services of their buildings under one single Total FM contract to achieve the maximum cost reduction through economies of scale.
2.    The delivery of FM services globally will always be only as good as the staff delivering them. As such, the customers of FM providers need monitoring tools on service delivery, consistency, and quality.
3.    As the quality of facilities improves worldwide, the customers of FM providers need to create and maintain a healthy, safe, and pleasant workplace environment for their people (wellness) to drive business productivity and profitability. 
4.    As the protection of the environment is a crucial issue globally, the customers of FM providers need to monitor and optimize the energy consumption of their buildings.
","1.    moralius employs modules to manage all the FM services of a Total FM contract such as Cleaning, Security, Technical, Catering, and other Support services giving the opportunity to the FM providers to offer a total consolidated solution to their customers.
2.    By employing Check-in/Check-out & real-time Service Tracking features via geolocation mechanisms along with real-time Staff Evaluation & Ticketing Workflows, the FM providers obtain powerful tools to deliver high quality services with consistency and business transparency.
3.    moralius employs IoT to get occupant data real-time to trigger specific events. For example, to operate the ventilation automatically when the air quality will be reduced to unacceptable levels or the hygiene steward to be notified to disinfect a WC after X visits.
4. Asset & Energy Management modules enable the FM providers to monitor and optimize the energy consumption, while Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence ensures the predictive maintenance of the building assets, as a result to improve the building value. 
","Moralius stands out of all the other FM software, as it is the first total FM cloud software, fully modular, with pay-as-you-go pricing model and no upfront costs. While all other FM software were created by software houses, Moralius was created by a total FM provider, in order to face the lack of a software suitable for total FM providers. This is the main part of the value proposition of Moralius to its clients, along with its continuous development, based on the very quick adoption of new features implemented to address the growing needs and new challenges of the Facility Management discipline.
Some features that make Moralius unique are:
·        It uses edge technologies (IoT, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, AI and 5G) to facilitate decision makers, simplify their daily routine and offer them the opportunity to act proactively.
·        Its clients can map all services they provide to their customers (Cleaning, Technical Maintenance, Security, Catering etc.), starting from the recruiting, management and real-time monitoring of the staff who perform the services and up to the evaluation of the clients and people who benefit from the services.
Finally, being modular, Moralius offers its clients a constantly high return of investment as they can easily choose the modules that fit best to their needs and budget at any point in time.
","So far, our team has developed and launched the minimum viable product (MVP) of moralius, which consists of eight (8) modules out of thirty (30) included in our product roadmap. 
These are: Site Visit Management, Service Tracking, Asset Management, Service Requests, Complaint Management, Quality Surveys, Staff Evaluation and Staff Ticketing.
Except of the access that a client can obtain through a web browser, a relevant android app has been developed as well.
Today, moralius is used successfully by one client – Outsourced FM provider – since 1/6/2020. This FM provider uses the above eight (8) modules managing real-time ~700 facilities of its customers (>700 customer users’ access).
Moreover, moralius Asset Management module has been provided already to one Inhouse FM provider as Beta Tester with no fee for six (6) months.
Finally, we are in the process of building our business plan in order to present it and raise funding for further development & promotion of moralius.
","Our team consists of five (5) passionate members with extensive experience in Facility Management & Software industry.
We bring the ideal peace-of-mind solution for the problems moralius solves, because moralius is the only FM software globally that is being developed by a total FM provider, while all other alternative products have been created by software houses.
Facility Management Market size exceeded USD 1 trillion in 2019 and is set to register CAGR around 5% between 2020 and 2026.
Technology becomes the pivotal driver of innovation in the industry.
As cloud service, moralius can be available anywhere with one click!
There are three different groups of customers for moralius. The first group is the “Outsourced FM Providers” which offer one or more Facility Services (e.g., Cleaning, Technical Maintenance, etc) or they offer Total FM solutions to their customers. The second group is the “In-house FM Providers”. Any organization in the private or public sector which obtains an in-house facility department in order to run, manage & monitor the facility services offered in-house into the organization. And the third group is the “Property Management Companies” which manage large properties in order to offer services to their tenants.  
For all groups, the same Revenue & Distribution model applies, which is based on a subscription cloud approach.
Finally, the following channels will be used for marketing & sales: social media campaigns, short video presentations, e-conferences","So far, our traction and achievements have been relied exclusively on our own funds.
We are willing to explore new funding opportunities that will give us the opportunity to make our product saleable in the Global FM Industry, while at the same time to continue developing the rest of our product roadmap.

Our target is to make this technology accessible to every patient by providing accurate personalised and low-cost solutions.,"The use of radiation for destroying a patient’s tumorous cancer cells is considered as the first treatment choice. Therefore, human phantoms made by conventional means are widely used in radiotherapy for estimating the dose of a patient’s radiation exposure. However, the phantom’s unanimous anatomy cannot meet the exact body-type of each patient, thus resulting in deviations of the estimated radiation dose and consequently in an increase of a patient’s side effects such as pain, nausea and tiredness. Our company is able to tackle the above limitations employing a novel technology for the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) printed patient-specific phantoms for radiotherapy using Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology. ","The advantages of this technology are: (a) increased accuracy of human organs replication than other 3D printing methods; (b) the development of personalized phantoms according to each patient’s body-type; and (c) the cost of a patient-specific phantom using the proposed 3D printed method could be more than five times less than using conventional techniques.

Ideally designed for everyday purchases, Mr. Pengu is an on-demand delivery app available through the App Store or Google Play and employs an organised network of drivers and riders, ready to deliver the product you were looking for at the requested address, within 30 minutes.

Recognising and respecting the importance of time, Mr. Pengu innovates by offering on-demand delivery 24 hours a day through innovative mobile technology. Through the app you may order any type of product navigating through pre-determined categories, such as groceries, pharmaceuticals, mini-market products, gifts and shops and courier services. The categories help you decide what you want, but the real innovation of Mr. Pengu lies in its 'anything' approach; you can write a text, send a photo or a voice message of your preferred product and our drivers will locate it and deliver in under 30 minutes!
","Mr. Pengu revolutionises online delivery, by becoming a household name for anything at anytime and anywhere the user may request, becoming the customer's necessary helping hand in going about everyday life. Existing apps place restrictions both on the consumer (he can order what he wants only from partner stores of the application) and on the employee-driver (specific activities without the prospect of development). Covid-19 has also highlighted the need for online shopping as an alternative to lockdown periods. Users can request any purchase from any store and not just choose from partner stores as in all other applications.  The app works in 5 easy steps: download, location, choose, pay and track. The platform is designed not only to serve daily shopping needs, but to also act as a trusted partner to local businesses, which are unable to offer delivery and/or courier services.","Mr.Pengu has an innovative business model which is applied to a new technology produced in-house for on-demand delivery. The start-up specialises in fast delivery under 30 minutes; the time factor is crucial for the competitiveness of the idea. The app enables the client to choose himself what product or service he wants with three different ways: describe it, send a photo or voice message and does not list any shops or have affiliation partnerships, establishing the company as viable due to the absence of a financial dependency with the retail work. The technology connects the Control Centre with each driver, with a unique POS system monitoring the pick-up and drop-off procedure. Furthermore, the company does not use any logistics but delivers immediately, which means that the operational costs are also kept at a minimum. 

The full development of the application follows the same model and the same design as the original application, which is already in operation. The only aspect of differentiation concerns the network of drivers which changes according to the needs of geographical coverage of each market and, possibly, the addition of new categories if there is strong consumer demand.
As part of its immediate plans for future development, a scaling scheme is presented which concerns Greece, Cyprus and the Balkans. The specific markets have been selected for their expansion dynamics and the high percentage of smartphone users.","The course of the company's revenues shows an upward trend. After the beta testing of the app and its improvement in 2020, the company expanded the body of drivers in order to enter the market with more vigour and offer services to all areas of Athens and Thessaloniki. It also expanded its range of services, achieving a high order efficiency index, over 95%. In 2021 our revenues will reach approximately €278,523 with an increase of 187% compared to €96,974 of 2020 that we started to launch our service. In September 2020, we signed an initial agreement with the company Nobacco S.A about 55 orders per day with an annual revenue of about € 45,000 and with a plan in 2022 to reach 100 per day. In June 2021, Mr. Pengu signed an agreement with LEO Riders Ltd, which brings to the company a guaranteed income of € 120,000 per year. The specific collaborations are an important step as the company has managed to catch the goals of 2021 and 2022 in early 2021.","Mr. Pengu is already in operation, proving that its operational model works successfully already. The in-house team is knowledgeable and has executed with success the launch of the app in Athens and Thessaloniki, with a positive track record, both in terms of operation and in terms of customer service. The company has developed a five-year business plan with estimated forecasts and scalability scenarios, demonstrating the dynamism and potential of the app. 

CEO: Giorgos Andritsos is an established entrepreneur with multi-year experience in setting up new ideas and investing in them to flourish. His role is to manage the overall operations of Mr. Pengu and ensure the business remains a profitable venture. CFO: The company's CFO is responsible for managing the financial actions of the company, including tracking cash flow and financial planning as well as analyzing the company's financial strengths and weaknesses and proposing corrective actions. He has over 10 years experience in the field. COO: Mr. Pengu's COO oversees the day-to-day administrative and operational functions of a business. Strategy and Marketing: Strategy and Marketing are responsible for developing a solid business development and marketing plan in order to maximise exposure, brand awareness and brand equity. Software Developers: our team of software developers has more than 10 year experience in IT development and software launch.","To be able to accelerate the growth of the company and meet capital needs, the company requires an initial investment of €3 million, to increase primarily the total number of drivers and to be able to design a proper advertising campaign to attract new users and orders. The company needs to configure its workforce in order to be able to cope with the increased volume of orders. To implement first substantial and holistic marketing campaign, the company must be ready at all levels to serve the increased volume of orders, which will result from the advertising of the mobile app.
The main goal of the requested investment is to lead the company to a plan including 300 drivers, 12,000 daily orders and 4,384,000 annual orders.
The estimated turnover is forecasted at 4,384,000 orders x €7 (average per order) = €30,660,000. The cost of payroll is estimated at €4,116,080, the operating costs at €1,384,456 and advertising costs at a rate of 15% on the turnover € and which amounts to €6,504,300.

1. We aim to open 2-3 physical stores in key locations, introducing this new model of consumption to the broader public. Within these stores customers will be able to buy our prepackaged products, but also buy in bulk, refilling their own containers. Once the model is proven we aim to collaborate with an existing large scale retailer and introduce zero waste corners within existing supermarkets (similar to bio corners)

MPS is the industrial sector that offers printing as-a-service. Instead of buying printers most companies buy an MPS contract for 3-5 years and pay a fixed and often uniform price per copy, across printer models in the fleet. It has always been a struggle to close the inefficiency gap between provider’s margin and risk and customer expenditure. MPS design has been highly dependent on long and hugely manual work time of scarce experts, imposing a heavy cost over each project. Meanwhile customers are much wiser on providers’ techniques but also on their own needs, having experienced the pitfalls, eg overinvesting on low HW usage and problematic SLAs. Today more than ever MPS providers need to navigate around lower print volumes, turnover, and margins. Avoravo offers them the opportunity to design MPS plans that cover each customer’s wish-list and printing specifications, definitively minimising the total operational cost as well as mitigating risk from shifting print circumstances.","We model a nonlinear location optimisation problem where a typical customer has several existing positions (slots) where clients can print. Each slot is associated with a print volume and must be served by a printer located in a zone inside a large floor or building; a zone for a printer might be a large subset of slots. The MPS provider is associated with a set of printers, each having printing limitations, fixed purchase cost and a printing cost that represents an irregularly formed nonlinear function. By applying a novel algorithmic framework our product provides a fast optimal solution that opens a set of zones and places a number of printers with the minimum total cost w.r.t. all limitations. The key-offerings of our product include optimal solutions in one step, efficient testing of unlimited scenarios and calculation/decomposition of cost per copy, a library of MFD devices with specs/costs easy to retrieve, single or multi-vendor option, extraction of eligible printers per zone.","To the best of our knowledge, our product offers the first approach that produces MPS solutions of optimal cost, enhancing the potential cost reduction compared to the current methods (our first sale, INTERSYS SA, have observed cost reduction up to 9%). Apart from cost savings, our algorithmic framework is very fast, computing optimal solutions in less than 1’’ for standard projects (up to 200MFD) and less than 20” for large ones (up to 2000 MFD). This is of huge practical importance, as MPS solutions currently require a few days of calculations by a team of 3-4 MPS experts. Contrary to usual limitations and errors of spreadsheet-based modeling that is mostly used in current practice, the increased computational efficiency of our product enables MPS providers to calculate actual costs for unlimited scenarios, in terms of different zone configurations, MFD selection or cost of consumables, all in split seconds, choosing a single or a multi-vendor option and thus, arming themselves with strategies not only for their offering but also for their competitors’. Interestingly, the created structure of input and output data, provided by users and computed by the optimizer, respectively, give rise to a novel business model which depends on the customer’s size (in slots) and strategic importance.
On the other hand, the MZDP team already has more ideas to create products for the printing device monitoring market that will further boost efficiency using predictive analytics and AI. ","MZDP received a USA provisional patent. As per patent search results, none of the listed patents were even close to the functionality of our patent. We already presented Avoravo to Hewlett Packard and Canon, top two vendors in MPS market, with enthusiastic reception and made our first sale to INTERSYS, leading MPS provider in Greece. Intersys won the two most demanding tenders of the banking sector, because of the speed and accuracy of the consultancy offered by Avoravo, as confirmed by end customers. Though COVID crisis challenged Intersys, as a print provider with plummeting print volumes, it was able to use Avoravo to offer fast business reviews to customers, re-optimize project fleets and automate trade-in campaigns, using half of the salesforce and only one solution designer so as not only leverage the crisis but take lead of competition. M2’s invitation, Europe’s leading MPS provider, to demonstrate Avoravo live at their premises in UK was an important step, awaiting fruition.","MZDP founders come from the Academic and Business worlds sharing a passion for bridging the two. They share Math and OR skills (mathematical modeling, discrete, data-driven and robust optimisation algorithm design, predictive and prescriptive analytics) and SW that supports optimisation processes, training at the highest level and claim proven business acumen. They are highly experienced on cutting-edge technologies for data handling, authentication, business logic, and on technologies that support optimization. They all have worked in the printing business for many years or have taken part in the commercialization of optimisation solutions.

Still after 20 years of MPS industry, there is no product in the world that does what Avoravo does. Our “competition” at best addresses peripherally the issue of design, using graphical interface (digitized floor plans etc.) or click cost databases to assist the designer with assessing the customer’s current and future state. The potential allocation of end users to printing devices is tried out by effectively manual iterations  which take long and is therefore short-cutted by empirical notions of print professionals. Assuming 10mio contractually monitored MFDs (tracked by Infosource or IDC) our growth potential all the way to 50% penetration and with 30% channel margin, i.e 15,000,000 EUR per year from this platform alone as it stands today.

In most cases, the embedded nanostructures have complicated morphology which is hard to be measured and quantified despite its critical role in product performance and safe use. The mission of Nanometrisis is to address the problem of the accurate and efficient measurement of nanostructure size and morphology through the development of innovative mathematical tools and software solutions to enhance measurement output.  Nanometrisis software have the ambition to complement the use of microscopes and other nanometrology devices in nanoindustries by the transformation of their output to efficient and quantified information  facilitating this way the digitalization of nanomanufacturing processes.  Nanometrisis is an innovative software company in the fast-growing field of nanotechnology covering the rapidly emergent need for accurate, reliable and targeted metrological characterization of nanotechnology products.","Nanometrisis develops innovative math tools and software solutions to enhance the measurement results and transform these to useful and efficient information bridging the gap between metrology and product design and improvement.  Since the nanometrology output is usually microscope images,   the above aim is achieved through the targeted and smart analysis of microscope images deriving from semiconductor industry, nanotechnology, material companies, microscopy makers as well as academia and research centers. The software of Nanometrisis are divided to two kinds depending on whether we consider well-defined lithographic nanopatterns used in the integrated circuits of electronic devices, or material surfaces and nanoparticles used in nanotechnology industry, pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies etc. Additionally, Nanometrisis provides technical and scientific consulting, in order to help and guide customers to find out their metrology needs and provide solutions. ","The software of Nanometrisis is characterized by mathematical innovation, i.e. novel mathematical and computational methods that meet the critical challenges of nanoindustries for accurate and complete metrology. This kind of innovation is exactly what is needed by our clients, in order to tackle with the problems that are met, as the size of their products shrinks at nanoscale. This shrinkage creates the need for accuracy and completeness in the metrological characterization of their nanoproducts which is covered  by Nanometrisis software. The linked, to the above, innovative model applied by Nanometrisis, is software customization accompanied by scientific and tech support (along provided to our clients). This means that instead of them (clients) getting lost with a vast number of output parameters in their hands (provided by a random software), that may or may not be useful to them, we essentially guide them (and offer them) to find out and distinguish only the necessary information that is being outputted by our software. This eventually saves them time, money and human resources. All of the above combined, is also the unique value proposition that differentiate us from our competitors       
","Our vision is to become an irreplaceable partner for industries needing accurate, reliable and targeted metrological characterization of nanotechnology products. Nanometrisis has achieved strategic collaborations with key players in all sectors of nanoindustry ranging from semiconductor and photonic industry to pharma companies and blade producers. Also, Nanometrisis has achieved strategic collaborations with key players in all sectors of nanoindustry ranging from semiconductor and photonic industry  (imec, ASML, Brewer Science, Moxtek) to pharma companies (Pharmathen) and blade producers (BIC). 
Finally, Nanometrisis is a pioneer in the application of Artificial Intelligence in nanometrology challenges. It has developed and presented in tech conferences and exhibitions a deep learning software based on convolutional neural networks to enoise microscope image and improve accuracy of nanomeasurements. 

","Nanometrisis is an innovative software company in the fast-growing field of Nanotechnology. The breakthroughs in this field at present days are numerous and the opportunities that arise in various subfields (pharmaceutical industry, surface enhancement, cutting tools, cosmetics, nanoelectronics etc) plenty. Since metrology at the nanoscale is a) demanding and b) directly linked to the success/operational performance of all nanoproducts, all of these industries are highly interested in having complete control of their line of production as well as their final product. Consequently, accurate metrology is of imminent importance to them. Hence the company’s growth potential depends on the company’s visibility and recognizability. The last has been highly achieved in the world of semiconductors and integrated circuits over the past years and it is growing in the second sector (nanoparticles and surfaces) with a special highlight in the world of nanoparticles. The need for accurate nanoparticle characterization and measurement will be strongly needed within the next time period, as European regulations governing the size and statistics of the particles that industries use, will soon be applied and forced.

1. A lab-on-chip kit for ultrafast (< 2 hours) and accurate detection of Legionella pneumophila bacteria in water. The chip is based on viable bacteria capturing by antibodies, and DNA detection by a visible color change. The same ship with small modifications can be used for other pathogens’ detection.
2. A lab on chip kit for molecular SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric detection in less than 30 min 
In the case of bacteria detection, capturing is performed on antibody-functionalized surfaces with a high efficiency and specificity, due to the high surface area – high biomolecule density and the specificity of the antibodies to the targeted bacteria. In both cases, following chemical lysis, DNA amplification is performed using LAMP (Loop mediated isothermal AMPlification), a molecular, highly sensitive method, while detection is again performed by a simple color change.","The core of our company is our unique plasma nanotechnology for surface functionalization. Our products are using this technology which in combination with the microfluidics knowhow in our company makes them unique in terms of performance and analysis time. 
Advantages of Legionella kit
a) The high sensitivity (it can detect less than 5 bacteria cells) 
b) The rapid analysis time (less than 2 hours instead of 10-12 days needed in current practice)
c) The ability to distinguish dead and living pathogens, and different serotypes and the extremely high specificity. Our product uses antibody-based bacteria capture AND DNA amplification. This dual specificity makes it technically superior to ethods based only on DNA amplification, or only antibody- capturing methods that are available in the market.
d) Portability (hand-held device that can be used at the point of need, i.e. the field of interest or a laboratory)
e) Competitive cost
f) No expensive equipment required
g) The need for less qualified personnel and no need for central laboratory
Advantages of SARS-CoV-2 kit and accompanying device
a) Molecular diagnostic screening tests for SARS-CoV-2 (Sensitive & Fast)
b) Cost effective solution (similar price with antibody/antigen or laminar flow tests with the sensitivity of DNA/RNA detection using RT-qPCR)
c) No expensive equipment required (e.g. thermocycler)

The company's main area of focus is the upper and lower respiratory system, which our first revolutionary innovative medical devices were developed to protect. Both Igmorino® and Anassa® delivery devices make use and take great advantage of Greek nature's valuable goods, rich in minerals, such as the Aegean sea's flower of salt, aromatic plant extracts with high healing load, as well as already known active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used in a topical and more efficient way.","igmorino® is a First-in-Class upper respiratory cleansing device, using a unique methodology, that enters the paranasal sinuses removing harmful bacteria and viruses that cause inflammation. 

igmorino® allows the selection of different solutions that could be used, such as: isotonic and hypertonic NaCl, herbal extracts and pharmaceutical solutions (future use). 

igmorino® induces and maintains a stable solution concentration in nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. Its prolonged contact ensures extended osmotic action following a quick application of the device, due to the successful filling of the paranasal cavities and its gradual drainage. The drainage rate is analogous to the presence and extent of local inflammation and it ranges between 3-24h. Thus, with a 3-5 minute use, 1-3 times/week, a therapeutic action is provided. 

","First-in-Class upper respiratory cleansing system, igmorino® enters the paranasal sinuses
removing harmful bacteria and viruses that cause inflammation. igmorino® delivers the solution into the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses – something that until today was only possible through sanguinary microsurgery – contributing to their successful and deep cleansing. Additionally, it also ensures that the fluid remains in the targeted areas for a sufficient amount of time to have a healing effect. Designed and developed by physicians, igmorino® actively contributes to alleviating and preventing nasal congestion. Many studies suggest that large-volume, low-pressure nasal irrigation optimizes the distribution and cleansing power. Due to its innovative (patented) mode of action, igmorino® achieves exactly that.
Whether using sprays or rinses for nasal irrigation, the main challenge remains to deliver the solution into the paranasal sinuses, which means acting at the heart of the problem. It is well established that the delivery of topical solution to the non-operated sinuses is very limited. Pressurized nasal sprays provide nasal cavity penetration at best, while squeeze bottle and Neti pot irrigation only achieve some maxillary sinus and ethmoid sinus penetration. The frontal and sphenoid sinuses are essentially not accessible with any of the existing products prior to surgery.

A ‘friends and family’ launch followed, with exceptionally successful results and positive feedback from early-period users. Functional samples were tested successfully in the UK, Greece and the Nordics. Nowadays, Neos wearables are available on neospay.com and support payment cards issued by banks in 13 European countries: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Poland. They can also be connected with Curve digital wallet throughout Europe.
Neos products have been recognized worldwide for bringing innovation to the e-payments industry. StartUs insights placed Neos among the 5 top wearables startups to watch in 2022. 
The market for payment-enabled wearable devices will reach US$7.2bn in 2024, “driven by a surge in contactless payment adoption, as a result of growing usage of contactless cards and near field communication (NFC)-enabled mobile payments,” ABI Research predicts. According to Mastercard, fashion brands drive the next evolution as wearable technology matures, creating wearables that are now high-end accessories rather than just functional.
","MVPs were demonstrated almost three years ago during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in partnership with Visa. Then, working samples were tested for over a year in the UK, Greece and Nordics.
Today, Neos has an established partnership with Swedish firm Fidesmo, specialising in providing passive tokenisation services. On top of that, Neos Cocoon and Polygon bracelets have been approved by Mastercard. Discussions on partnerships with banks, card issuers, payment providers and local distributors are in progress in different countries.
Also, Neos participated as a vendor in the pilot program of using NFC wearables in the German public transportation system to push forward contactless transactions in the context of response measures to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Additionally, Tesla drivers can securely connect their car keys and payment cards to a Neos wearable. Open the car door, start the car, pay for charging, buy a snack mid-journey, or pay for the weekly shopping
with a piece of jewellery.
","We are a well-experienced and result-oriented team that made it happen for the first time globally — a team familiar with the tech, jewellery and product design environment. And we firmly believe that investing in e-payment solutions is in the right direction in a world where cash is falling rapidly. 
A combination of technology maturity, consumer popularity, familiarity with contactless payments, and the unique external phenomenon (and notably Covid-19, whereby contactless is being pushed as a safe and hygienic alternative to cash by the payment networks, merchants, government and the World Health Organization) is accelerating today’s market adoption of contactless technologies. Wearable devices are primed to take advantage of this trend, increasing choice and flexibility in form factors and available payment methods. But most importantly, wearable payment technology can quickly converge with other applications, such as loyalty and rewards, fitness and health, ticketing and transport, access control etc., offering new revenue streams and business opportunities for the various stakeholders.","Building module-free designs are one of Neos’ priorities for facing upcoming competition in this emerging passive wearables market. That will help us change the form factor of passive payment-enabled jewellery and wearables and stay steps ahead of design flexibility. Module-free designing will give us a valuable IP.
At the same time, we want to expand Neos’ footprint in the markets where we have already started selling our products through marketing and promotional activities and establishing partnerships with local retailers and distributors. Business development also focuses on building B2B partnerships with banks and fashion brands.
To cover those needs and expand our product portfolio in new markets, we seek 550,000 Euro pre-money.",,,,"[{'title': 'egg - enter grow go', 'year': '2020', 'type': 'Program'}]",Bootstrapped,NA

To achieve this mission, the company is developing a cluster of engineers that come together on a project basis and provide solutions in the most efficient ways. Whether it is a complex production method needing to become more efficient, or a bespoke facade of the highest construction standards. We can provide a range of solutions, from consulting to complete design, prototyping, and testing of the solution proposed.

We provide outsourced Research and Development with the most flexible team of experts. As a demonstration of our capabilities, we designed the first product of our range and showcased it in a number of companies in the EU, attracting initial interest for further cooperation.","The solar energy production industry is facing a great boost in demand, as a result of the greater energy shortage caused by political turmoil in Ukraine. The new product is offering a sustainable and innovative solution for mounting photovoltaic panels on flat roofs of residential and commercial buildings. The designed system is from light and rigid materials based on aluminum extruded profiles. The new product allows for the utilization of flat roofs that would otherwise not be utilized for the installation of photovoltaic panels. Furthermore, the installation in urban areas is easy and fast without the need for specialized equipment reducing the cost per installed kWp.","The product is awarded a patent from the Greek intellectual property organization and a request is submitted for evaluation in the European patent office also. The innovative design is essential to allow the system to penetrate a growing market with great potential. Once in the market, the product will be fit for installation in most European countries following a series of tests in individual certification bodies. The market in western Europe is mature as flat roof photovoltaic generators are installed at a very fast pace. Usually, the installation of photovoltaic panels on roofs is coupled with the installation of EV chargers assisting the mobility electrification targets along with ESG compliance scoring. 
The market demand/product acceptance will allow for industrial-level production of the system in a specialized facility. Raw material (extruded aluminum profiles) will be supplied in local factories as Greece is a major producer of similar products. Sales in western Europe will be assisted by the cooperation with a company in the Netherlands, strategically positioned among the BENELUX and DACH areas.","By the end of 2022, the testing round for the system performance will be completed. Based on the finite element analysis method the system performance is already proved to be according to Eurocode specifications for areas with show load and wind load typical for Central Europe and south Europe coastal regions respectively. The system performance will be also evaluated by an independent certification body. In the previous months, 3D print samples of the system parts have been produced and tested for their ability to properly mount photovoltaic panels. The assembly steps and mounting instructions were also evaluated. 
The result of the computational system evaluation will allow the product to go into preliminary production. Extrusion dies and samples will be ordered and the initial parts will be evaluated for their quality and reproducibility.
","The growth of the solar panel mounting system function of NK Design, is following the safe pattern for expansion. The product is in competition with major installers/suppliers of systems in the EU so the realization of a very aggressive sales policy with representation in multiple countries is not favorable for a startup of this size. The strategy of choice is to form an alliance with a major player in West Europe and retain the production facilities in Greece. This way it will be possible to control production parameters to the highest possible standards while keeping costs at a competitive level. Large sales volumes are expected to be directed to mature European countries such as Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Smaller volumes are expected to sell in the Greek market following sales agreements and demonstrations to major installers. Direct sales to projects will be retained to high-volume installations (i.e. industrial roofs, logistics e.t.c.) where bespoke project evaluation will be needed. Specialized software that will calculate the installation parameters and bill of materials will be developed in coordination with the customers/installers/traders to simplify the ordering process. Alternatively, the system will be included in existing software packages that estimate the required materials for a project. Usually, these software platforms operate on a commission fee based on orders gained through the platform, hence minimizing the CAPEX needed as a start capital.","Two funding rounds are planned: one round is necessary to complete the development and certification of the proposed photovoltaic panel mounting system on flat roofs. Estimated needs up to the go-to-market stage are 100.000 euros. 
In the second phase, a production facility for the industrial-scale production of the mounting system is planned. The project will be eligible for grants through Development law 4887/2022. The total expected capital needed for building, equipment, and working capital is estimated at 1.000.000 euros, subject to the submission of a proper business plan.

As an early stage startup, Noesis is developing its smart technology solutions & services as a result of EU H2020 and Horizon Europe research RTD projects in collaboration with global technology providers and strategic partners. 

Key areas of interest for its RTD activities include:
•Smart Manufacturing
•Cultural Heritage
•Advanced Materials
•Renewables & Construction
•Smart Cities 
•Healthcare
•Cybersecurity ","Noesis Technologies is developing an intelligent machine vision solution called smart
quality monitoring and control system (Smart-­‐QMCS), primarily for the Additive
Manufacturing market. Prototype Smart-­‐QMCS makes use of Machine & Deep Learning
models and algorithms for in-­‐line process monitoring, by quickly acquiring, processing
and interpreting high-­‐resolution stereoscopic images of extruded (3D printed) resin
material, further controlling in real-­‐time a robotic arm to adjust or discard faulty parts
and address current challenges in Additive Manufacturing processes, thus improving
overall product and process quality, while at the same time minimizing production lead
times and material waste. In addition to Additive Manufacturing, NOESIS’s intelligent
machine vision solution (Smart-­‐QMCS) could be further customized to address
complementary manufacturing industries to solve and support their quality monitoring
and control issues, mostly in discrete and high value manufacturing sectors, such as
Automotive, Aerospace, Shipbuilding, Renewable Energy, Machine Tools, etc.
The Smart-­‐QMCS solution has been initially developed, validated and demonstrated at
industrial settings, as part of H2020 project KRAKEN (https://krakenproject.eu/), where
NOESIS has participated as a technology developing partner, by designing, integrating
and testing its machine vision solution on a robotic arm fixed to a large area moving
crane system with the robot handling.","NOESIS’s Smart-­‐QMCS solution has already been very innovative in the
design and construction of its stereoscopic multiple camera machine vision system, as
well as in its fast image processing software algorithms. Now, as part of its further
market exploitation commitment, NOESIS is further extending its product innovation by
incorporating machine learning and deep learning algorithms into its Smart-­‐QMCS
solution for becoming directly competitive with more advanced related solutions and
support a more extensive set of manufacturing industries, further to additive
manufacturing. This will provide a major competitive advantage versus many existing
competing solutions. Of course, further and continuous effort and investment will be
required to scale up and expand the list of clients and markets. Moreover, for the
business model to become more competitive and innovative, NOESIS will expend its
product competitiveness by developing a Smart-­‐QMCS Cloud Platform, where all
relevant client manufacturing processes will be connected, remotely monitored and
where applicable controlled, a functionality which is adding significant value to its
offering and consequently could become a game-­‐changer to its competitiveness. On the scalability side, we intend to accelerate our
platform product development plans, aiming to support multiple clients remotely and
further integrate our solution with 3 rd party software platforms such as ERP and MES
solutions. ","NOESIS has achieved some critical milestones in product and commercial development.
Further to the initial Smart-­‐QMCS system prototype, it has made an agreement with
Noesis Technologies to further develop in collaboration the solution and embed machine
and deep learning algorithms and models, accommodating faster and more accurate
industry requirements. It will further improve its relation with leading AI Cloud platform
service providers, such Microsoft Azure and AWS. Achieving a quailfied
system/application developer status within their ecosystem, will provide a huge boost in
the visibility accreditation of NOESIS’s solution towards its targeted clientele. This is
scheduled to take place within the next couple of years and is another major milestone
to be achieved. At the same time, NOESIS has started to pilot Smart-­‐QMCS system
implementations with various industrial clients in order to test, validate and improve the
performance of its solution. Three (3) such contracts with industrial companies have
been signed for pilot implementation within this year, with more expected immediately
after. Finally, NOESIS is planning to collaborate closely and become a system integrator
for ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), MES (Manufacturing Execution System) and
ROBOT/COBOT system providers in order to integrate its solution with their platforms
for industrial clients. One (1) such contract with a COBOT/AMR systems provider has
already been signed in that end.","The core team consists of members covering the different key disciplines and aspects
required for a solid business and commercial venture initiation and support. Specifically,
the teams consist of Mr. Dimitrios Karadimas, with more than 30 years experience in
senior technology and business development management positions in multinational

The true essence of ΝΟΜΑΔΑ. The natural ingredients, the perfect terroir, the heritage of the recipe itself, the travelling and maturation of the recipe in time .In any way you see it, ΝΟΜΑΔΑ can be found everywhere. 

Honey Lemon soda, a beverage naturally made with long heritage, deeply rooted in ancient remedy recipes, re-imagined today and offered with a set of functional health benefits, for people with hectic lifestyles who would love to enjoy their “missed breakfast natural honey intake” anywhere and anytime.
We carefully select authentic thyme honey from Crete’s unlimited summer sun, biodiversity with rare plants and animals. Our honey is a natural energy boost with a flamboyant floral taste and fruity aftertaste with hints of citrus. Our juicy Sicilian lemons grow around Mount Etna, where the Mediterranean climate of sunny hot days and cool nights. 
","The last few years, the products that are related with alcohol have been attacked based on extensive research that shows the bad implications alcohol has on people’s health (especially youngsters), the addiction it creates and even more the extensive problems on the skin and its aging. Consumers, when turned to non-alcoholic beverages, found-out that cola beverages that dominated had also bad health effects as well as bad addiction. 

Since 2011, almost 70% of the new non-alcoholic beverages that were launched, were non-cola beverages, half of them carbonated and half non-carbonated. Tea products were the mostly launched but also mixers have been very popular as well. (eg Fever Tree,Thomas Henry, 3cents etc) 
Now, we enter the era of functional beverages that have a clear and obvious benefit for consumers well-being. Their market share increases substantially and they gain considerable shelf share. A succesful example is the “KeVita” probiotic soft drinks, acquired bt Pepsi.
Moreover, in addition to the functional element, there is a steadily growing trend for “adult soft drinks”, a category which is filling the gap of the decreasing trend of alchohol consumption.
The solution is the “adult soft drink” which keeps the “look and feel” and experience of drinking, and the sense of “belonging” to the social drinkers, yet without drinking alcohol, and standing out from the crowd.UAE countries, where alcohol is forbidden, is a big opportunity
","NOMADA honey soda, is a product that is based on an ancient recipe, one of the oldest recipes in the world. It is based on Cretan honey - well known globally for its healthy attributes – and Sicilian lemons – well known for their antioxidant effects. 
The specific combination in the recipe creates an energy booster that is much healthier than the existing and had additional health attributes as well (detox, weight loss, digestive, boost cognitive performance, helpful for cold & respiratory infection etc..). At the same time, based on original raw materials, it carries only 16 calories per 100ml.  It is also carbonated, creating a gold beer-like foam, steming from the natural honey. 
NOMADA range will keep on focusing on the original, baseline recipe and will not include new ingredients thus focusing on the nutritious effects of their combination.   
","We have touched base and discussed with several importers/distributors who have expressed interest and requested for the “organic nomada” , and will engage as soon as the organic version is in the market.

- Future-proof. We don't lock customers into proprietary technologies and we export code for popular frameworks. 
- No limitations. We support custom UI layouts, which are not limited by templates, and custom application logic that is not limited by prefabricated code libraries.
- No operating costs. There are no extra (hidden) charges for the end-users of the apps built with the platform.
- Learn in days. Non-experienced in coding can learn to use our platform in days and master it in weeks so that they can focus on building their applications.

There is an increasing demand for low-code platforms and alternative software development processes. Larger market incumbents provide older tools that lock customers in very expensive legacy technologies. In parallel, medium-sized organizations start to embrace the low-code approach.

Oil is one of the biggest areas that need and require change in the next years but data on it remains scarce and forecasting is not widely and accurately available. Data and data transparency on oil is much needed by all the various stakeholders involved in the energy transition. Energy Market operates in real-time but current data is lagging by up to 3 months. Also, current analysis methods are time consuming, prone to human error, and do not operate around the clock. Finally, deep sector expertise and advanced analytical capabilities are required to meaningfully and timely process vast oil market data.","A big part of our work is to combine conventional oil statistics with real-time data from satellites and marine intelligence to deliver a digital twin of the global supply chain and an accurate measurement of the global oil market. Our web-based platform creates the most comprehensive and coherent visualization of the global crude oil & refined product market. We consume and interpret satellite data with AI technology to bring advanced oil analytics, 24 hours 7 days a week. In addition, our data driver research offering provides oil traders and analysts with indispensable market analysis. Finally, our team of industry leading Oil Analysts and Senior Data Scientists provide a bespoke service that combines the best from both disciplines, helping our clients solve their most critical business challenges.","We combine conventional oil statistics with real-time data from satellites and marine intelligence. We then use AI to fuse the different data sources into one single source of truth to deliver a digital twin of the global supply chain and an accurate measurement of the global oil market. This gives an updated picture of the oil market fundamentals (global supply – demand balance). In this way, we have a view on the global oil market and understand what each country will produce or consume during the current month (we call that Nowcasting). In summary, our algorithms fuse cleaned-up oil market data with up-to-date satellite data, to create exclusive market insights. The platform automatically updates the information for any country daily (24/7) and therefore allows users to make better-informed and faster decisions with greater confidence. It is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than currently used manual methods. To achieve this, we use AI algorithms and concepts from meteorology (Nowcasting) adjusted to the oil industry.

The platform uses in-line, wireless & Plug-N-Play sensors to optimize fermented food and beverages quality control. Oliveex has performed several pilot installations and Proof-of-Concepts in Greece, some of them with key players of the Food & Beverages industry like Athenian Brewery, the largest beer producer in Greece and part of HEINEKEN Group. We are currently focusing on the alcoholic fermentation market (beer, wine, spirits, etc.) and address this as the ideal initial target market since they are ready to adopt high-end technological solutions. Breweries and wineries are already familiar with the usage of sensors to perform their daily quality control however without using internet-connected sensors and without exploiting the collected data, either to improve precision or to improve digital traceability. In conclusion we are initially targeting the alcoholic fermentation market however our goal is to expand our scope to fermented foods in general (dairy, plant-based, etc).","Our IIoT platform offers the needed digital transformation and introduces remote quality control, using IoT devices that are 24/7 attached and collecting data. Through our platform, producers will be able to improve precision by using data, while also replacing manual quality control processes (e.g. sampling and lab analysis) to cut costs. We provide real-time analysis by monitoring the environmental and chemical state of the product and also the different gas concentrations (CO2, O2) in the tank’s exhaust. However, we are not providing standalone sensors for specific metrics but an all-in-one integrated platform that will combine different metrics to export complex chemical data and use them for actionable, real-time, predictive analytics. Data is used both to strengthen traceability with digital identity for each batch that includes information from all stages (production, fermentation, maturation & storage) and also for evaluation of the production methods and in used ingredients.","Nowadays, fermentation and maturation processes are mainly based on schedules rather than data, due to a lack of field-specific technology solutions. Addressing these difficulties and knowing that the only way to maximize precision is to use cutting-edge technologies we developed Oliveex’s IoT-enabled solution. Our attractiveness or our competitive advantage over the existing solutions is that Oliveex’s 360° solutions offer the utilization of Internet-of-Things architecture for remotely monitoring production data and producing actionable and predictive analytics. Also, with the exploitation of data through machine learning algorithms it is possible to evaluate production methods and optimize them. Our core features are described below:
A) Simplify the quality control process. Using a device that is 24/7 attached to the storage tanks, collecting product data the customer can monitor the product status without the need of taking samples and analyzing them. 
B) Real-time alerting, minimizing sampling errors. With periodic data collections at least 6-times a day and using high precision sensing units we minimize wrong readings about the product chemical state.
C) AI integration and data exploitation. Using data analytics and reports, the fermentation process can be modeled, split into stages that later can be identified as the critical stages, the stages with the most product spoilage, and those that can get optimized by controlling their storage conditions.","Oliveex has performed several pilot installations and Proof-of-Concepts in Greece, some of them with key players of the Food & Beverages industry like Athenian Brewery, the largest beer producer in Greece and part of HEINEKEN Group. Interest was also expressed from fermentation tank constructors both to integrate our solution to their upcoming tanks (to improve innovativeness), and also to retrofit in the already installed. Sales process has just started, but we already have received positive feedback with 50+ active leads and one distributor (annual capacity of 500 tanks) contract being official soon (letter-of-support provided). Well-known university labs that work closely with industries in R&D (letter-of-support provided) have also expressed interest that can increase connections. Since Oliveex have recently closed its pre-seed funding round and currently have the financial resources for an optimal sales expansion we are expecting significant growth in the following months. ","We all studied at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Thessaly. We know each other for more than seven years and during this period we have participated in a lot of projects, some of them in IoT. Active advisors currently are university professors that help us with product development but also people from the fermented foods market that we collaborated with during pilots. They are helping us with their expertise and also providing us the ability to have an active testbench during development.  
However, the biggest achieved milestone in our opinion is our product development roadmap by now. Starting in 2018 and in less than a year we achieve to deploy a fully-functional prototype, test it in industrial conditions and get in touch with key industries of the fermented food market receiving also precious feedback that helps us grow and adapt to the current market needs. In the second year of development (2019), we deploy our solutions in the biggest market of fermented foods, dairy products, and run a round of pilot installations with promising results. After two years of continuous development and pilots, working with limited financial resources we achieved to convert our beta testers to initial clients and start our scope expansion to beer, wine and, hydroponics.

The company was born as a result of the merging between experienced travel industry professionals and talented software engineers. OneTourismo has manufactured an innovative reservation system for Travel Agents and Tour Operators.

At this moment more than 85 travel agencies have chosen the technology solutions and expertise of OneTourismo. The company uses leading edge technology in order to provide innovative, complete and tailor-made solutions for travel agencies, tour operators, travel wholesalers, online travel agents, Destination Management Companie's and other travel professionals.

Understanding the growing demand for incoming tourism in Greece, OneTourismo has created unique features, such is a BackOffice System for manual adding Hotels, actvities and transfer services in Greece, unifying hotels from about 40 suppliers and systems in Grece, as well as offering a Distribution Network to resell those products on a Global basis.  
","The Travel Agency wοrk routine is complicated and time consuming and to a certain extend still offline. So even to reply to an enquiry or make a booking, many steps and systems are required from the Agent to learn and use.

Our company has developed an ""one stop shop"" online reservation system for Travel Agents. The system offers the following services: Flights, Hotels, Holiday Packages, Transfers, Activities, Rent a Car.  On the system we have developed real time connectivitiy with around 50 diferent systems and suppliers in order to provide instant availability, prices  and online bookings to any of them. The system also offers connectivity to the accounting software as well as generating quotations by simply clicking on the products needed and sending them directly to the customer's email for review.

So the employees of Travel Agencies can very easily and through a single interface find the right products, send quotations, make bookings and automatically send the invoices through their accounting system..

The Travel Agents can also add the System on their website and sell directly to end customers. They can also provide personalised access to other Agents or Corporate Companies so that they can make B2B bookings. ","Onetourismo provides a Central and Web based Reservation System. This means that the user can log in to the platform through any device, no local installation or infrastructure and no IT personnel is required from customer's side. Maintenance and updates on the platform are made centrally, so only one main version to maintain. Regarding Technologies used we combine cutting edge ones. The NodeJS is the main runtime environment because it offers high performance asynchronous request handling. A MongoDB for data with no relationships between them, and MySQL as a relation database. When it comes to geospatial data, PostrgreSQL is our choice.

The values that diferentiates us from the competition, is that the system while Central, it does provides a range of choices in terms of both the Front End (design and flow), as well as back end functionalities. So while all our customers get the same vesion of the product, they can easily customize to their own needs.

We do provide a relatively smooth and quick SetUp for every new customer. There is no need to involve developers on the Setup procedure, nor install any infrastructure. It just takes a support agent to do so, but at the same time it can be easily adapted to the needs of every new customer, regardless of the sector of activity of the Agency or its country of origin.

So new customers coming on board can be easily come on board and get trained by few support agents.
  ","In only 3 years time, Onetourismo has managed to provide to the Travel Agency sector a technological product that makes their daily routine much easier and quicker.

After only 3 1/2 years we have achieved to reach the largest portfolio of customers in the Greek Market. More than 85 customers are currently using our services, which is almost twice as much as the customers of our closest competitors in Greece.  
  
Important milestones are the first hotel bookings that were generated on the system in March 2018.

Another milestone is the sigining of our first customer abroad and more specifically in Australia, Greece and Mediterannean Travel Center.

In May 2020 our company signed an agreement with Manessis Travel, the biggest Travel Agency in Greece, employing more than 100 people.

Although Travel Agency industry is largely affected by Covid19 and bookings coming from Travel Agencies have decreased by around 65% in the past 2 years, our overall turnover in July and August only was higher than the turnover in the whole of 2019.  This was a result of the platform offering more products and services to the users, as well as a costant growth on the number of Customers getting the platform.
","Our company is consisted of two shareholders, George Bountounis as CEO and software house Codefactory.

George spent 4 years working as an E-Sales Manager for a hotel chain in France. Then 4 years in a boutique Travel Agency in Greece, where he realised the problems in the routine of a Travel Agency. He then assigned to Codefactory the manufacturing of the platform and asked them to join forces with him.
Nikolaos Tsagkas Vice President of Codefactory is also the company's CTO. He is the architect of the platform and a great mentor for the developers.
Nikolaos Papafotis is the Lead Developer. he has been constantly working with us since the beginning. George Skepetzis our new IT addition. After his first months of training he is now engaged in demanding projects. Dafni Georgiou is the support supervisor. She has previously been working for Hotels, making her ideal to train and solve our customers' issues.

Our target is the sector of Travel Agents. There are about 6,000 Agencies in Greece only. The platform can also be used by any agency in the world, but a realistic goal is to target TAs in Europe and Mediterannean. Amongst the 85 active customers using our system, around 10 are based outside Greece (Cyprus, Romania, Serbia, Italy, Israel and Australia). We have also received bookings from agencies or end customers from about 35 countries.

Technically our goal is to continue developing a unique tool for our cutomers and for expand our sales network in other countries.  ","We are looking for funds in order to reach a more International Clientele. This would require technical and commercial actions.

From technical side, we would need to hire 2 new developers in order to develop extra services (Insurance, Flights etc), new features (Dynamic packages, layout, functionality), as well connections with more suppliers and systems. Also, get extra server space.

From commercial side we would need to hire an experienced and a junior Sales Manager, make Google Adwords or Linkedin campaigns, exhibit in international Trade Fairs (WTM, ITB Berlin, WTM Arabia, Travel Tech London etc), possibly develop Sales and Support Offices also outside Greece and of course dedicate an increased amount for travel expenses.

By applying the above plan of actions, we would be able to target new and larger Travel Corporations, increase the costs for getting our Software in order to be closer to the competition’s Average costs. We would also notice a significant increase of income from booking fees, since more and more agents would be using the system hence making bookings and paying booking fees.",,,,,Bootstrapped,NA

Onskull cooperates with various platforms / e-shops in order to promote and then sell its software through them. These are: Steam, Nintendo, Playstation, Humble Bundle,SpringBoardVR and Google Play. The company uses social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube to further advertise video games. For the advertisement either on the above platforms or on social media, a small excerpt of the video game is presented which is enough for the potential player to understand what it is about."," Onskull’s video game production is based on computers and consoles. The themes of the video games mainly include 1) logic problems, such as escape rooms, where the player is asked to gather as much information as possible in a certain period of time to solve a mystery or to get out of a locked room, 2) adventure / horror video games, where under difficult conditions such as low brightness or unexpected events the player has to explore a specific area to reach his final destination. It is noteworthy that all video games are multiplayer and thus allow players to connect with either friends or strangers and interact together.","The application of virtual reality and its functions are still being explored. There are many who do not yet own a VR device and this limits their interaction with others that have. Onskull, in order to contribute to the interconnection of the two aforementioned “teams” resorted to the creation of cross play. In short, it allows users without a VR device to play along with those who do have VR, in the same game. Adding an innovation like this, in combination with multiplayer, as well as the presence of its video games on various platforms such as Playstation and Switch, Onskull has managed to be a pioneer in the field. ","Two years have passed since the start of Onskull. During these, the company managed to create 8 games (Escape First 1,2,3, Tales of Escape, Curious Cases, The experiment: An escape room, Escape 2088) and to sell a total of 300 thousand pieces. Also, through its expansion to other consoles other than Steam, it grew its market and gained many more users. At the same time, the company entered into agreements with entrepreneurs to get its video games in their VR arcades (VR equipment rental spaces / VR Cafes).","With the introduction of Virtual Reality, the growth of this industry is even more favored since there are many who want to try something new and different. The software produced by Onskull is aimed at people aged 12 and over who have an appetite and enthusiasm for puzzle and adventure games. To expand its market and reach, OnSkull uses social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube as well as publishing in all major video game platforms such as Steam, Nintendo, Playstation and Google Play.  It is noteworthy that all video games are multiplayer and thus allow players to connect with either friends or strangers and interact together.","As the video game industry has shown rapid growth in recent years and as everything shows it will continue to do so at an even faster rate, one possible issue that is likely to affect OnSkull’s work is funding. Video games take a long time to make, with multiple people working for months or even years on a simple project, before reaping the rewards after the game is finished. OnSkull has managed to circumvent this problem with smaller production cycles and a smaller team, leading to shorter games with limited advertising budget. Longer games, however, are more popular with players, and a substantial marketing budget can help a game break a certain threshold in popularity, allowing it to go viral. Both can increase our market’s size significantly. In addition, a larger team could achieve concurrent release of a game in multiple platforms, effectively “combining” the release “hype” and increasing the effectiveness of our marketing. The company is currently at a stage that can scale faster if more is invested in games development and promotion.",,,,,Series B,NA

Hence, there is a lot of interest gathered around solutions aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of cargo vessels. Among those, weather routing solutions today, have managed to save only 3 to 10% in fuel consumption, per voyage. The problem is that marine weather forecasts, which are the catalyst of routing performance, have reached an accuracy and resolution dead-end due to the chaotic character of the modeled physical processes. AlongRoute comes to change all that. With groundbreaking AI-based models, we have managed to overcome the physics barriers and for the first time, we are able to produce marine weather forecasts of unparalleled accuracy and resolution. With our data, weather routing solutions can perform up to 130% better than today, with a huge impact towards a greener, safer, and more cost-efficient maritime.","AlongRoute's data-driven AI models learn how physics work by ""imitating"" vast amounts of measurement and reanalysis data and do not depend on physical modeling. Thus, we are reaching unbeaten accuracy levels in comparison to our competitors who mostly offer third-party data (e.g. ECMWF) from traditional models. We offer highly-accurate input to our customer's systems, along with their preselected vessel routes of service. Our plug-and-play APIs are designed to work efficiently with any system, without any extra fuss. Moreover, our solutions are developed in-house and thus are fully customizable to serve any customer need.

Our strategy and pipeline are mature and ready to scale up to the global oceans in a swift and efficient manner.","Our smart developed, trained and operated AI models which can perform equally, and in some cases better than existing numerical models. However, our models are projected to become better and better, whereas numerical forecast models have long reached their performance dead-end. Also, in contrast to numerical models, our set-up is extremely efficient in terms of computational resources and thus can easily produce forecasts in fine spatial and temporal resolutions on a global scale.","The team has been supported and funded by the DigiCirc Blue Economy Accelerator to develop the first PoC, Business Plan, Market Research, and MVP.

Within the broader area of this technology, photonic integration has a key role for the development of compact photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with large number of elements, stable operation, small footprint and low power consumption. There are however two critical issues for the design of high performance PICs and their use in practical systems: 
1) The know-how required both at the component and the system level for the design of photonic elements and their combination in the form of large-scale circuits.
2) The availability of smart electronics to control the various photonic elements on-chip and coordinate their operation according to the specifics of each application.","We work along the innovation chain of products based on PICs, offering design and prototyping services. In more detail:
1) We design micro- and nano-optical elements for PICs on various integration platforms including silicon photonics, silicon-nitride and optical polymers.
2) We develop system concepts and design PICs filling the gap between photonics at the component level and real world applications. Examples include designs of photonic integrated equalizers for optical communications, optical phased arrays (OPAs) for laser beam scanning, as well as carrier generation units and optical beamforming networks for mmWave and THz systems.
3) We develop control electronic units for PICs consisting of a smart digital part that runs the configuration algorithms according to the PIC design and application, and an analog part that drives the photonic elements in those PICs.

Apart from our service provision activity, we announced in the beginning of 2023 the release of our first commercial line of driving engines as standalone products. Those engines will be also used as building blocks inside our PIC control units that will come onto the market later in 2023.","The following assessment regarding the innovation and uniqueness of our value proposition can be made:
1) Design of optical structures for PICs: Our work is innovative in the sense that the structures we design are usually developed for the first time on the particular integration platforms or are at least developed for operation in new wavelength regimes.
2) Development of system concepts and system design of PICs: Our work is based on ideas outside the box. They are innovative and unique, and can lead to the generation of Intellectual Property (IP). Examples include our optical equalizer deisgn and our optical phased array (OPA) concept that have resulted in two discrete patent families.
3) Control electronic units for PICs: The uniqueness of our proposition value is associated both with the programmability of their digital part and the customization of their driving part. Compared to commercial solutions, our drivers are unique in terms of variation of driving parameters and channel counts, and thus able to meet the operation requirements of large-scale hybrid PICs.","2016-Oct:

Digital advertising refers to all kinds of communication made by a company to advertise and promote its brand, product, or service using various platforms and digital channels. 

Marketers utilize these channels to communicate content to audiences of specific characteristics like location and demographics. Subsequently, marketers monitor the audience's actions to measure the promotion's performance based on specific in-product metrics (KPIs).

This analysis is essential to the marketing decision-making process and is critical to each organization's marketing strategy as it indicates growth opportunities. 
This analysis incorporates a massive amount of data that the majority of the marketers handle manually using traditional spreadsheets or other static reporting tools.
Hence, modern marketing organizations find themselves evaluating the quality aspects of promotions and making budget and strategy decisions based on time-consuming and prone-to-errors manual effort.
","The Optaily solution takes advantage of state-of-the-art technology in AI and marketing decision-making technology. 
It gives marketers the tools to:
- automatically build media plans based on historical data, 
- manage campaigns across multiple advertising channels, 
- optimize performance by near real-time KPIs evaluation, 
- and generate custom reports for better insights into their advertising promotions results. 
","Optaily brings innovation to the advertising industry by transforming traditional manual operations into automated ones efficiently. 
The above becomes possible by implementing multiple machine learning and problem-solving algorithms customized to each advertiser's needs. 
The majority of the existing solutions approach the issue unilaterally, either from an abstract and purely technical perspective, becoming impractical for the marketers, or from a purely marketing perspective losing the technical efficiency required to handle the fragmented digital advertising ecosystem.
Optaily brings modern automation technology, structured and designed around the exact business processes that marketers currently use during a marketing campaign's lifecycle. Optaily focuses on today's Ad-tech ecosystem that requires help spotting the marketing interactions that add incremental value.
","While the Optaily solution still evolves, it is currently in production and serves two mobile advertising networks/agencies, transforming the way they operate.
Important milestones:
1) The AdCredible advertising network used Optaily in 2020 to win the trust and cooperation of Bytedance to promote the TikTok app in the UK and in Germany. Optaily processed thousands of events and traffic channels, protecting TikTok's budget by saving them more than 500k$ on advertising spend.
2) The AdBiotics advertising agency used Optaily in 2021 as the key business point to win the business of Symantec to promote the Norton Secure VPN and Norton 360 apps. The Optaily optimizations automation is crucial in achieving the client's Performance and ROI goals.

We believe that companies have a duty to treat all stakeholders fairly. 

Growing companies are struggling to keep their cap-table clean, becoming a more significant issue when trying to grow through fundraising, which can be cumbersome, and may throw investors off.

We at OptIn know very well how difficult and challenging it is to grow a company alone. With our solutions, that issue is eliminated as we transform the way businesses grow by sharing ownership with key team talent, which drives the company's performance and keeping your cap-table digitalised and clean.

We think ownership, team members and investors differently, and with the new era of shared ownership through share options, we came to revolutionise your view as well.

Togetherness is the new way to align your mission with your people and the rest of the stakeholders.","Our platform has 3 stages.

1st stage, we digitalise the equity and automate everything around share issuance and share options. But also provide each stakeholder with a bespoke dashboard view of their portfolio and the ability to see how it grows. Also, we built an educational program for the option holders.

We will automate even the complex valuation process with our sophisticated algorithms (AI later stage) based on the revenue, fund round, industry, general market etc. (benchmarking tool)

We are solving the illiquidity problem with the second and third stages:

2nd stage, With a live secondary marketplace (we call it a stock market for private companies), where we make it easy and secure for companies to share their success and growth with all types of investors.

3rd stage, the OptIn Fund platform will bring a community of investors (OptIn included) next to the option holders with vested options and will provide non-recourse finance and get the upside once the company exits.
","Our competitive advantage firstly is that we will offer the whole experience to the users, meaning to the business by automating everything around equity and share options, and being more flexible than others in the industry, with the bespoke share option scheme to the needs of each business. But also, we will provide the opportunity to the employees/early investors or the business itself to liquidate, especially with the current market where the companies take longer to go for IPO.

Most importantly, we will be the industry leader in automating the valuation of private companies with sophisticated algorithms and move to AI calculation at a later stage. That will give people a better assurance of the secondary market and increase the already historic high 2021 interest in the secondary market.

In the EU, the restrictions on share transfers can be a burden for a few, but with our automated process, we overcome that burden and complexities, and we can move to a live secondary market.

Lastly, equity builders leave the options on the table as they do not have the cash to exercise; with our OptIn Fund, we will bring a community of investors (including OptIn) that they compete to fund the vested options with non- recourse finance, and they will have a return on an exit or the secondary market.
","We have established a partnership with 2 accountancy practices; they are keeping their more prominent clients equity digitalised. But also their clients have discounts on our Saas product; hence they introduced us to some of their clients for the share options module.

We are also in talks with VC to make a partnership in the EU. They have a pre-requisite for their portfolio to provide Share Options to their employees. That is a sound proof of concept but also considerable potential for a new revenue stream and good brand awareness.

Nevertheless, despite our platform being in Live Beta and not advertised yet, we have seen a warm increase in our leads, and we are negotiating with a few companies, from startups to well-established companies that make over €40mil per year and have over 400 employees.

Also, we were among the finalists in the Envolve Entrepreneurship Award Greece 2022. We entered one of Greece's most successful business accelerator programs, EGG.","Our team consists of very experienced in their field individuals, with over 10 years of experience each. 

We understand the legal and mechanics around share options and equity. We help you make sharing equity with your talent as simple, automated and transparent as possible through our platform.

We are currently growing in terms of clients as well as hiring.","OptIn is looking for a funding with the following needs in mind:

This loss comes typically as a result of economies of scale and digital gap, oftentimes the two main factors driving the cost of manufacturing/service providing.

OptiSol.io envisions closing the gap, by identifying key activities driving up cost in SMEs, and that are low-added value, repetitive, with a high degree of human error, lacking optimization. The opportunity we see relates to the Industry 4.0 digital transformation of SMEs and the introduction of modern technologies (IoT, AI) in a cost-effective, fast, and easy manner.

Currently our solutions (in product and MVP phase) are focused on the agritech, healthcare, and smart city sectors addressing costs for businesses values at €4B, €650M, and €7B at the EU level, respectively. We see the opportunity in obtaining a portion of that market share by being competitive in terms of innovation and price.","The core of our solution lies within a set of proprietary algorithms utilizing AI techniques to optimize routine processes while eliminating errors and uncertainties introduced by humans. The algorithms are modified on demand to accommodate the needs of each group of clients, based on a series of available data.

We also offer the in-house expertise to develop IoT devices capturing data of interest and a team of experienced data scientists.

To facilitate the use of our solution, our service is delivered in a custom-built SaaS platform where input can be easily introduced, processes can be monitored, and analytics on process metrics are reported. So far, our solutions have received awards and positive feedback, domestic and internationally, at pilot and competition phase.","Our innovation lies in that we group the needs of a series of SMEs and create sector-tailor-made products offering the efficiency our competitors offer to large corporations.

In addition to that, our algorithms, methods, and approach have proven more efficient and faster than other published state-of-the-art competitors. Indicative of that are the nVIDIA developer award of a paper related to AI-aided diagnostic imaging, the New Generation for New Agriculture funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and the Juan Ramón Guillén Foundation awards for our agritech MVP.

Furthermore, the grouping we do for each category of service offering allows us to offer competitive prices. In addition to automation, modern techniques, such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, are utilized to enhance the reliability of the system.

On the agriculture side our innovation is funded on the fact that we automate a process by means of IoT devices. In addition to automation, modern techniques are utilized to enhance the reliability of the system, such as computer vision, artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the Decision Support System, actually being implemented utilized innovative technologies such as generative adversarial networks and recurrent neural networks for the optimization of the spatiotemporal pest control action.

Through collaborations with inventors both in Greece and abroad and the distribution power of our co-investor, Uni-Pharma, we are developing advanced solutions for ""Connected Diagnostics"". We focus on test kits for antibody testing with high reliability, easy and rapid usability, and competitive cost. Samples are collected with a finger prick or nasal swab. Results are provided through a smart device that quantifies an optical read-out from the sampling kit. We're he product development and its regulatory approval.","A high-performance AI-assisted paper-based COVID-19 antibody test kit (Nanospot.ai Inc) has received regulatory approval and it has launched to the Greek.


","The inventive step has to do with the combination of fast and reliable. Usually these two things do not come together, especially in In-Vitro Diagnostics. Our technology enabled by modern spotting technology at the nano scale, Artificial Intelligence, and advanced biochemistry can disrupt the current state of the art by adding expedience in a test that is currently reliably performed only in a lab setting and at much higher cost. The product is supported by a patent-pending invention and is highly scalable, as it relies on software, antigen production, and specialty papers.","Opto was established last January as a response to the need we predicted for reliable, affordable, and rapid mass-scale antibody testing for the COVID pandemic. We have screened dozens of potential technologies. We have invested a lot of time and money to develop one of them. After in-depth market research with critical suppliers we realized that the cost to develop the MVP (as well as the final product cost) would be prohibitive for a mass-scale product. So we pivoted modifying our original plan for a more realistic product/market fit and developing an alternative fund-raising plan for it. In parallel, we attracted an alternative technology that is more mature and can decrease the time and capital needed to reach the market. We have entered two tech-transfer relationships with NCSR Demokritos and a leading US research institution. We have received seed funding amounting to 266.600 EUR from Uni-Pharma, one of the leading Greek pharmaceuticals.","We are cooperating closely with our US-based partners and Uni-Pharma to certify and manufacture at exponential pace our first antibody test kit.

This health crisis is the direct result of a lack of innovation in medical training over the last 150 years that has meant that the profession can’t keep up with the demand. The WHO is projecting that by 2030, there will be a staggering deficit of 18 million medical professionals. Meanwhile, the number of fatal medical errors keeps rising due to the fact that medical training is highly intensive: a master/ educator operates on a patient and the trainee/ apprentice observes and learns on-the-job, often practicing on real patients.
Medical virtual reality (VR) training can change all that. Clinical studies have proven that medical VR training improves patient outcomes; however, current VR content creation cannot keep up with the demand, due to: a) lengthy content creation times b) high authoring costs and c) a very large number of different medical operations that need to be simulated in VR.","ORamaVR aims to accelerate the world’s transition to medical VR training by offering an IT software platform called MAGES™ SDK (Software Development Kit). This platform empowers institutions and developers to massively create high fidelity medical Virtual Reality Simulations 8 times faster and for one eighth of the cost relative to current industry standards. These state-of-the-art simulations can thus quickly and more affordably be made available to hospitals, medical device companies, medical schools and medical training centres to train and assess their medical professionals. The outstanding benefits of this award-winning platform (MAGES SDK) have been demonstrated in 4 published clinical trials. Aside from drastically reducing development costs and delays, the platform has been proven to provide effective skills transfer from the virtual to the real operating table.","As VR is becoming more refined and accessible, the benefits of incorporating this engaging and highly scalable technology into medical training programs are widely discussed and acknowledged. The number of professional VR content providers is growing steadily, yet the fundamentals of content creation are the reason VR education is not yet a mainstream option in medical training. The gap between growing shortage of health workers and what the existing medical training system can supply is too wide to be filled with the existing VR content creation technologies. Truly useful and comprehensive medical training would require tens of VR modules per each procedure. The process of building virtual settings is time-consuming and costly -creating a single operation module takes months of work by multiple developers and designers, and eventually highly costly. 
The MAGES Software Development Kit (SDK) allows code-free/low-code creation of hyper-realistic VR simulations of medical operations by medical professionals in a matter of hours. This makes it possible to create a rich collection of detailed training modules, a base for a leap forward in virtual medical education landscape. With MAGES, medical professionals need to create and model only a storyline using our custom visual scripting editor and record their actions within the VR scene while interacting with the virtual patient and virtual OR equipment, making it a catalyst for the most effective, yet risk-free medical training.","ORamaVR was founded in 2016 and received initial €575K pre-seed financing from the VC PJ TECH CATALYST FUND in Greece. The company has moved its HQ to Geneva, Switzerland upon strategic partners' demand. ORamaVR is adopted by the USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, NYU Langone Medical centre in New York, the University of Geneva and the Inselspital Hospital system in Switzerland, FORTH and the University of Athens in Greece and recently Western Governors University, Fayetteville State University and the University of Michigan in USA. Medacta International, a leading Swiss medical implant manufacturer expressed high interest to collaborate intensively with ORamaVR.
ORamaVR has been awarded in 2020 an Epic Games Mega-Grant, in 2019 the Augmented World Expo (AWE) Auggie award for ""Best Societal Impact” and the prestigious FARE award, from the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) in 2018. ORamaVR has attracted more than €1.3M in R&D grants and awards up to date. In 2020 ORamaVR concluded a €370K bridge round led by HTC Vive, a leader in enterprise virtual reality.","Our team has decades of engineering and commercialisation experience in VR applications and education technologies.

The main problem we have identified is that the order management experience for both restaurant owners and suppliers is manual and error-prone, which introduces costly mistakes and inefficiencies. According to one of the largest FnB meat distribution company in Greece ""My biggest headache comes from human errors in the order entry or management process which leads to problems further down the supply chain which we ultimately have to incur"".

One of the sources of the inefficiencies is that there are multiple and sparse communication channels including phone, sms, email, IM platforms and fax, which significantly increases the supply chain coordination costs. According to an interview with Kiosky's, a popular mini-market franchise, “Having to communicate with 50 different suppliers and filling my inventory gap takes almost all of my time”. 

On average, these inefficiencies cost 70% of one restaurant employee's staffing time. On the supplier's side, 20% slowdown in order management.
","Our aim with Orderit is to revolutionise the Food & Beverage (FnB) industry by creating a modern digital order management tool that drives efficiency and helps both restaurants and suppliers scale. As CEO of Alibaba, Jack Ma, once said “The most valuable businesses are the ones that help other businesses grow seamlessly”.

Our product is a web app which lets venues make their orders easily and seamlessly in seconds. The process of onboarding them is straight forward and they immediately have access to their suppliers as well as valuable analytics for their business.
","Our startup is innovative both in its technology and its business model. Firstly, it is employing next-generation UI elements and the most advanced user experience frameworks to provide users a seamless and easy to use interface. In addition, on the backend we use advanced algorithmic methods to organise our databases to enable quick filtering, and use machine learning to come up with dynamic filters that get generated based on the types of products that users upload on the site. These technologies allow us to give our clients a better experience not only visually, but also provide price suggestions and advertised content that will be valuable for their businesses. Secondly, our innovative business model focuses on integrating both venues and sellers with our order management process and allows us to collect data at every step of the process. We then feed useful analytics back to those clients for a price which adds value to their businesses, helps them manage their workforce better and control their cost base. By collecting all the data and using predictive analytics we can develop in-house products, help route logistics more efficiently and make personalised recommendations to clients.

Parking finding not only stresses drivers but also contributes up to 30% to the total city traffic and increases air and sound pollution proportionally.
On the other hand with parking control & enforcement today, cities need to make sure there is a constant availability of parking spots 1) in front of the local stores in order to help the local trade b) in all residential neighborhoods in order to ease local residents' parking quests.
At the same time cities need to fight illegal parking and also maximize their parking income from out of town visitors in order to balance their city budget. The cities in order to meet those challenges typically invest in hiring teams of parking officers cruising the city, a rather expensive, inflexible and inefficient process.
In the era of industry 4.0 and of automation unfortunately today's parking problem are solved manually and require many manhours .
","We use computer vision and Automatic Licence Plate Recognition techniques in order to help cities fully automate their on-street parking control and enforcement tasks and help them manage efficiently their parking resources. At Parkingstream, by registering -at street level- the vehicles’ entrance and exit times for each city block/street, we can identify the parked vehicles and calculate their parking time. This info is correlated with the electronic payments data and in case of a mismatch an e-citation is issued. Like that Parkingstream can help cities eliminate their parking enforcement expenses and at the same time maximize their parking revenue. The services we provide are: Street parking availability detection, Parking payment, Automatic parking control and enforcement, street traffic light tuning based on traffic and real flow, street traffic light warning/activation for pedestrian notification, stolen vehicle finding, city vehicle traffic, delivery/supply vehicle tracking",Parking control and enforcement is one of the few tasks in our every day life that requires the use of human resources. If we assume that in the future labor tedious works will dissapear then in the future an error prone activity like parking control will also become fully automated. The existing solutions for parking control and enforcement require either the use of human resources (expensive) or the use of one camera per parking spot (big overhead) .

In Athens, PDN operates the sales/marketing services. Its product lines include but are not limited to medical devices, sensors and software for the monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of patients suffering from Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and other movement disorders. PDN implements and maintains a quality management system according to ISO 9001:2015, an information security management system according to ISO 27001:2013 and a quality management system for research, development, production, distribution, sales, marketing, scientific and technical support of products related to medical technology, according to ISO 13485:2016. All audits were performed by DQS Med and DQS Hellas.
PDN’s first product, the PDMonitor®, was certified with a medical CE Class IIa by DQS Med in June 2019.
","PDMonitor® is a non-invasive continuous monitoring system to be used by patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), with the consultation of their attending physician.
The system consists of:
> a set of five (5) wearable monitoring devices,
> a mobile application, which enables patients/caregivers to record medication, nutrition and non-motor status information as complementary information for the motor symptom assessment, and
> a physician tool, which graphically presents to the physician patient movement and patient
related information.
The physician tool reports are at the disposal and judgement of the attending physician and could allow for a better and objective assessment and understanding of the patient’s PD symptoms.
The PDMonitor® system can be used at any stage of the disease after its initial diagnosis and when the patients are under medical treatment.
Three actors compose the PDMonitor® user ecosystem:
> patients being at any stage of the disease,
> caregivers – formal (nurses, volunteers) or informal (relatives, family, volunteers) – appointed for specific patients,
> physicians (medical doctors – Neurologists experts in movement disorders or Neurologists or General Practitioners trained to interpret PDMonitor® reports).
","Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a major cause of disability. Patient’s quality of life and disease progression depend on consistent and prompt assessment of motor complications and optimal timing & dosing of treatment, currently based on subjective diaries and routine visits to the treating physician. Treatment is often delayed and non-optimal, leading to rapid symptom and Quality of Life (QoL) deterioration, lost days from work, falls, hospital stays, high mortality, time spent to travel and wait in the clinic and increased cost for the Healthcare System. PDMonitor® is used by the patient to enable an accurate, home/work based, continuous motor symptom evaluation, coupled with information on lifestyle and drug adherence. The Mobile App allows the patient to register required information about his/her individual situation like medication intake, nutrition, activities of the day and about his/her subjective feeling (free text and/or multiple choice).The patient also has access to an analysis about his/her current health status. The healthcare provider (treating physician/nurse) has a complete understanding of the patient status and disease stage and progress through the Physician tool, which is a web-based tool allowing the treating physician to modify the treatment in an optimal way, which is communicated to the patient and caregiver.This tool also allows for patient grouping of the treating physician who manages the treatment of several patients in a timely and efficient manner.","Following PDMonitor’s® launch in Greece (September 2020), PD Neurotechnology® has already achieved private patient and hospital traction in Europe G5 and Sweden, Ireland and Cyprus. PDMonitor® has been embraced by 80 certified physicians (as of 15/05/2021) across EMEA and the US, actively advocating PDMonitor® to their patients. Major Pharmaceutical and Medical Device companies are in advanced discussions for a collaboration with PDN.
PDN has established a distribution network in EMEA, while next step is the FDA clearance to enable sales in the US.
Reimbursement efforts are in progress in the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Russia and the US. PDMonitor® enables a paradigm shift in PD treatment, with the active participation of the patient and the caregiver leading to a proactive and personalized data and healthcare delivery, and the efficient involvement of all ecosystem actors (treating physician, caregiver, nurse, etc.) in his everyday life.
","Health-related wearable technologies are still in their infancy (particularly in relation to neurological conditions). PD Neurotechnology’s (PDN) is thus a sector leader, with its multi-sensor approach and system architecture that, unlike its competitors, monitors all Parkinson’s Disease (PD) symptoms, in a continuous, user friendly and actionable manner, allowing for prompt staging support and treatment optimization. PDN’s product pipeline includes PDMonitor® II and special variations for advanced treatment options, while plans are made for other CNS conditions and 2 commercial products.
PDMonitor® targets 3 market segments: Private patients/ Hospitals, Healthcare Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), Pharmaceutical and Medical Device companies.
Private patients are driving early revenues. Following the successful launch of PDMonitor® in Greece and the rest of Europe, private sales are forecasted in Germany, Sweden, Cyrpus, Spain, UK & Ireland and Italy in first half of 2021.
The process to achieve sales to HMOs and getting reimbursement varies by territory and necessitates: 1) Improved QoL and clinical outcomes; or 2) Cost effectiveness. Part of this is already adequately advocated, following early clinical trials and expert options. New clinical trials are generating additional evidence to support reimbursement. Depending on the country, local trials and demos may be fully funded. Marketing Campaigns will raise product awareness among KOLs, physicians and patients.","The business is at an inflection point in terms of growth and has just secured 1.5m eur Series A funding. Next financing steps include the identification of an experienced financial investor, most likely US focused, who can understand PD Neurotechnology’s sector, strategy and market position and support its expansion, enabling the company to gain global exposure, maximizing their innovative technology value.
Existing and future funds will be used for Working capital to deal with the delay in production, commercialization and clinical trials caused by the Covid 19 pandemic. They will also cover part of the cost for PDN’s R&D pipeline.

Our team members have previously worked in academia, research centers, serious & VR games, and semiconductor industries. Our mission is to develop world-leading software solutions to enrich visual user experiences with cutting-edge 3D photorealistic rendering technology.

The Product: Phasma3D™ was developed as a result of more than 6 years of intense R&D in the Computer Graphics Group of AUEB aiming to be the best SaaS tool for 3D product visualization & marketing content generation on the web.

The Technology: WebRays™ is the first generic ray-intersection API for the Web. Ray tracing is the baseline for high-fidelity visualization on games & movies and our vision is to bring this level of quality to the eCommerce, Augmented Reality and the Metaverse.","In an era, where electronic shops begin to thrive, due to the efficiency, variety, and product feedback, there are still products and services for which simple static images or 360-degree rotating photos cannot convey their full qualities. This is especially true for physical goods, where online, immersive customization is an integral part of the sale through a digital channel to a private end user. Providing the freedom to accurately explore a range of products significantly bolsters the assurance of the client when performing an online purchase and raises the satisfaction rate of the delivered products or services. Thus, this translates to an immediate return benefit in the form of increased sales, while also affecting the reliability and online image of the business. Furthermore, engaging the visitor with an impressive and intuitive product presentation can lead to higher customer product education and engagement as well as website retention rate, in general. 

Phasmatic has created Phasma3D, the first adaptive web-based photorealistic rendering solution using programmable ray tracing technology, offering the accurate 3D visualization of products for previewing and customization purposes. Phasma3D aims at putting 3D content on the web easily and everywhere with a few lines of HTML code. We primarily target the typical use-case scenario of client-side visualization, but further, allow more practical applications such as Virtual & Augmented Reality (VR/AR) support.","Phasmatic offers a shift from “just convincing” 3D content presentation to “properly realistic” interactive 3D shopping experiences through novel web-based visualization technology. The heart of the 3D visualization engine is the revolutionary proprietary ray tracing technology, developed over the past few years at the premises of AUEB, with the financial support of national funding resources and industry grants.

Yet free-form surface design is still notoriously hard and time consuming, and currently requires heavy, complex and expensive Computer Aided Design (CAD) software packages. It is estimated that more than half of the time spent by users of CAD software (which amounts to several billion dollars in cost annually) is directly related to free-form surface design. 
To answer this market need, we developed Phi, a CAD software product that is cloud-based, easy to use and learn, allows design of top quality manufacturable models and offers a huge speedup (at least an order of magnitude) of that design process. Phi renders this very difficult and time-consuming task easy, manageable and pleasant, without sacrificing precision and engineering accuracy. Phi allows everybody - including novices - to realise and produce their 3D design ideas, thus not only helping experienced designers but also expanding dramatically the current consumer market.","Phi uses state-of-the-art and proprietary technologies, algorithms and mathematics (including “n-sided surface patches” which we have taken to a new level) to enable everyone to freely design and manipulate 3D shapes, with top quality, watertight and smooth surfaces, allowing users to focus on their design ideas.
Phi offers easy and intuitive organic design of top quality surfaces, instantly capturing the design intent. It implements the “curve-based design” principle: The user simply draws natural free-form curves reflecting their design intent, and the software automatically fits nice, top quality surfaces that contain the curves. No expertise or training is needed because of the simple, menu-free, but powerful and intuitive GUI.
At the same time Phi offers engineering quality, accuracy and control, bridging ease of use with precise engineering.
Phi is cloud-based and runs on any browser, and also offers interoperability with other CAD systems (and 3D printers) by supporting several standard file formats. It has already been integrated within two major CAD applications.","- Proprietary cutting-edge technological infrastructure: Our curve-based design approach, based on our proprietary research and development of n-sided patch mathematics and algorithms over the past several years, gives us a clear competitive advantage allowing an effortless style of free-form design that is not found elsewhere.
- Cloud-based: Very few of the CAD/3D design applications are completely cloud/browser-based (and none so for surface modeling). This is a clear advantage for reasons of platform/device independence, simplicity, accessibility, collaboration, ease of updates, etc.
- Simple and intuitive user experience: We have placed a lot of importance in providing a simple and intuitive user interface, without huge menus, with clear, quick interactions (many of which may constitute patentable material). E.g. tools such as carving, split-patching, fairing of edges etc are completely revolutionary.
- Interoperability: Phi is already integrated within Onshape, the largest professional CAD cloud platform, and allows ""live updates"" where design changes within Phi can be sent over to Onshape with a single button click. Phi supports file formats that allow exporting to other applications and 3D printers, for example. Countless more new features and capabilities are already in the pipeline, either being designed or already being developed.","Phi launched in 2021. We have had and are having very positive feedback and praise from our users, whose number has been growing. 
Most are from design firms, who have expressed interest in our software and its capabilities. Users have been providing us with a lot of feedback, resulting in major upgrades of the application with improvements and new functionalities (https://phi3d.com/updates). This feedback helps drive priorities and direction  for exciting new features and functionalities in the pipeline.
We have already explored the possibility of technology licensing agreements with other companies, which led to very successful technological integrations of our product to drive freeform organic surfaces within host applications for the first time. This resulted in a lot of enthusiasm and initiated discussion of potential strategic investments in our company, so our future plans include more partnerships, apart from a stand-alone version.
Develop3D (D3D), the industry leading publication for CAD, manufacturing and 3D printing, recently included Phi in their illustrious D3D-30 list of top technologies for 2022.

The company is a spinoff of the Institute of Communication and Computer Systems (ICCS) and is operating as a Private Company registered in Greece.
","3D bioprinting is a great invention of our generation, and one that will ultimately transform healthcare in the near future. Laser bioprinting can be utilized for the creation of tissues and organs suitable for regeneration and drug screening, with the ultimate objective to cure previously untreatable medical conditions. 
PhosPrint developed an innovative dual beam laser bioprinting device and a process which comprises novel surgical protocols for on-site laser bioprinting of autologous urothelial cells.   The Dual Beam bioprinter, with a dual wavelength, prints and post-processes bio-inks on demand and as  a result, we can print highly cells with viability and at high speed (~1 million cells per sec), and succeed printing in vivo with efficient immobilization of the cells on the receiver substrate.  The first application of our technology is Bladder reconstruction, following cystectomy to treat bladder cancer. Bladder augmentation or replacement remains a challenge because enterocystoplasty, the gold standard method for almost a century, is accompanied by severe complications in the vast majority  of cases. To address this issue, we aimed to develop a new method that could provide a fully functional bladder composite devoid of side effects.
","We have developed the first technology capable of repairing/generating de-novo human tissue during surgery, starting with cystoplasty. 
To date, bioprinting has not yet been incorporated in the day-to-day operations of surgery units. This gap is what PhosPrint identified as a major opportunity. The proposed approach addresses the need of surgeons for advanced regenerative medicine tools for tissue engineering and repair.
The initial bladder application is highly promising as also indicated in the LOIs from KOLs and prospective customers (see attachment). D-LIB protocol comprises procedures for cell isolation and expansion under GMP conditions from autologous biopsies, cell expansion in-vitro, and cell printing in-vivo. It is a completely new technique in the sector that avoids the dangers of conventional neobladder treatments that rely on intestinal epithelium. 
We plan to invest in an in-house assembly, since D-LIB manufacturing uses scalable methods, which can be automated with limited investments.  We will also establish GMP laboratory agreements with key hospitals in EU countries. The selection of sites will be based upon patient turnover following EMA approval.","Company incorporation (February 1, 2019).

It was founded in 2017, as a subsidiary of Horizon S.A., a Renewable Energy company. 
In an era where there is a growing demand of consumers for “cleaner” and “greener” products, with less or no artificial ingredients and more natural ones, we decided to invest in the agrifood sector and in the exceptional Greek nature so as to take the best out of it. Our vision is to contribute to the industrial transition to “clean label” products by providing powerful solutions to industries. To this end, we focus all our power to develop and produce innovative natural ingredients, based in thorough research. In this way, we help our clients to give added value to their products and ultimately to the consumers.
","Our mission is to produce botanical extracts and natural bioactive ingredients. We started by setting up contract cultivations of 40 acres of aromatic plants and cornellian cherries, in order to be able to ensure the best quality of our products in all processing stages. Also, we invested in research & development of innovative products. In collaboration with the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, we have developed three technological formulas: an antioxidant extract which expands products’ shelf-life (suitable for foods & cosmetics), a colouring extract that gives natural pigment (suitable for foods) and a feed supplement for ruminants that promotes milk production and good health of the animals. All of them can substitute artificial or potentially harmful additives that many industries already use. Our portfolio also includes a list of botanical extracts, suitable for food & cosmetics industries. ","Physis Ingredients has strategically decided even from its very beginning the continuous investment in R&D in order to develop innovation and stand out of the competition. We have achieved to develop innovation both in our products and the production method. 
The method offers a number of advantages to the products: a) High solubility of the bioactive compounds, b) Compatibility with food matrices, c) High bio-availability, d) High stability, e) Masking of the bitter taste, f) higher efficiency. It also ensures that the production takes place in low temperatures, therefore it is environmentally friendly. In addition, the method foresees the availability both in liquid and in powder form, which offer great advantages in regards to self-life and logistics, among other scientific benefits. 
The products are unique, as they are custom formulated and proved to be equally effective to other widely used additives, and so, they offer solutions for industries that seek natural alternatives to established additives.
In regards to scalability, the company has easy access to raw materials markets and so, access to bigger quantities and variety of materials in order to enlarge its capacity and enrich its product portfolio. The company aims to create new production products for industry’s needs. It also plans to expand its processing facilities in the next five years. Strategic partnerships with investors are included in the near future plans, as well as funding from relevant programs. 
","In our first 4 years of running, we have achieved to implement the investment in 40 acres of cultivations and three research projects, all of them self-funded. The last ones served as the basis for the development of our competitive advantage. In the meanwhile, and during raising our readiness level (TRL), we have also conducted our production, marketing and investment plan. In addition, we have won two first awards in start-up competitions in our first two years.","Physis Ingredients is a family company. 
Stella Chatzigavriil, specialized in strategic product design and branding, is the general manager of the company and responsible for the development and the marketing strategy. Savvas Chatzigavriil, experienced in business administration for more than 30 years, is the founder and decision maker of Physis Ingredients (and its mother company, Horizon S.A.). Another person with vast experience in plant extractions is production manager. External collaborators (research scientists, producers, consultants) also contribute significantly in the company.

Our growth strategy is based in the continuous development of innovative products that respond to new demand of the customers. In the “why us” question, the answer is because:
- Our products are custom formulated and unique 
- Our products are proven efficient through thorough testing for the intended applications
- Our production method offers significant scientific and business advantages
- Availability in both liquid and powder form of our products meets the custom need of the customers

Considering and including the alumni in their efforts to achieve their business objectives can be a success factor for any organization. Business development, marketing, recruiting, and the reduction of the operational expenses that are associated with them, are key processes that most companies tend to depend on employees, consultants, or customers to help them optimize. 

Our mission is to help companies get help at a much lower cost from those who are willing to give back, their alumni!","Alumni as brand advocates are worth more than employees or average customers, which means that engaging alumni in social networks can strengthen the company brand. Employees who move on, often move up the corporate ladder, and therefore alumni can be decision-makers or influencers to existing customers and prospects, while engaged alumni can also offer referral business. In both cases, there are shorter sales cycles, besides the revenue benefits. A boomerang hire or a referral hire can improve most recruiting KPIs, while an alumni program significantly improves the employer’s brand. 

Alumni Reach offers private cloud-based online community platforms, enhanced with tools to assess the alumni profiles, make communication targeting more effective, incentivize alumni engagement, and promote the exchange of knowledge, expertise, and professional opportunities within the network. ","Professional social networks are our indirect competitors since most of the companies that are reaching out to past employees are mainly using professional social networks. Mainly due to its size, LinkedIn is the major player currently and it is used by most companies to track and stay in touch with their former employees.  However, this is a complex and not very efficient process, since LinkedIn offers limited functionality and lacks many of the tools, that modern alumni platforms offer. 

Existing alumni platforms are mainly on-line community platforms that tend to target educational institutions like universities and colleges, or large enterprises. The ones that are targeting corporate alumni networks lack the tools to help companies assess the alumni data and make alumni targeting more effective, and do not offer any structured way to incentivize engagement within the network. 

Our target market consists of all medium and large companies in the EU and USA. According to OECD, there are more than 400.000 companies, which makes our total addressable market 2b EUR (bottom-up method). We will focus on the Services Sector and the medium-sized companies starting from Greece and then expanding to the UK and then the EU and then the USA. This means that for the first year we are targeting more than 1.500 companies with 50-249 employees in Greece.

Argyris has more than 13 years of managerial experience in the FMCG and Telco sectors.

Current retail mobile apps entail high cost and complexity for SMEs and users. Imagine you’re the owner of a neighborhood retail shop. Your customers increasingly shop with their mobiles, but creating a mobile app is difficult and expensive — that's why only 16% of EU SMEs conduct e-commerce. You contemplate partnering with a delivery app, but they charge an eye-watering fee, and then aim to serve your customers through their own dark stores. Furthermore, delivery company apps cannot be customized to your special needs. The Plimni app solves these problems by allowing you to enter your products, and offer them for sale to your existing customers as well as other members of the Plimni ecosystem.","The Plimni super-app* mobile application aggregates supply (retailers and producers), demand (consumers), and functionality (offered by independent software developers) to provide a low-cost, friction-free, feature-full service. [* A super-app is a mobile app that can provide multiple services as a platform.  Examples include Alipay, WeChat, and Grab.]

Plimni as an aggregator super-app allows consumers to use a single app, customizable for the unique needs of each retailer, for all their shopping. It also allows retailers to collaborate on delivery, product entry, and marketing.

Furthermore, Plimni as a mobile app allows cell phone shopping on the go, coordinating and simplifying product delivery. Delivery can happen through click-and-collect or their shops' own services. Shops download the app and, in hours, can take online orders, thus onboarding mobile e-commerce at a low service cost.","Plimni's key innovation is its ability to serve bespoke app customization modules, named Plimnets, on demand. These solve the scalability problem of monolithic applications that either offer limited features or crumble under their own weight by trying to satisfy everybody and nobody. It is a feature that has been successfully employed on the web by Shopify's plugins. However, web apps lack native mobile app responsiveness and features, such as background location updates, push notifications, and barcode scanning. Moreover, deploying applets on mobile phone applications is difficult due to the closed nature of the Apple and Google app stores. 

Plimni's proprietary platform technology, based on a microservice architecture, server-side on-demand transpilation, secure sandboxing, and public key encryption allows modular applet development, deployment, installation and provisioning, thereby fueling the development of applets. The integration of further advanced (though not unique) technologies further enhances the Plimni's versatility. These include background location updates and associated order scheduling algorithms, product import APIs, barcode scanning, and the delivery of regulated products.

Plimnets, developed in-house or by independent software vendors, can serve customers, retailers, and producers. We have identified more than 80 Plimnets. Individually developed, deployable and installable, they can serve verticals, such as  loyalty schemes and clothes fitting.
","The Plimni phone app (currently available on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store) is already being actively pilot-tested by retailers and customers. We have automated critical operational processes, such as business registration KYC, payments, and invoicing to achieve operational excellence and scalability. We have developed and deployed several Plimnets. We have also amassed a product database featuring more than 30,000 SKUs to simplify the shops' product entry process. The software development team has setup processes for working at scale and the product engineering team has streamlined the application's delivery and operations.","Plimni's founders have been cooperating and exchanging business ideas and expertise for years, trusting each other and sharing the same values and high aspirations on everything they do.  They combine deep and varied experience in technology and consulting.

The company's plan is to grow by regions (Greece, Europe, world) and by serviced retail sectors, increasing its consumer base and market share.","Plimni is currently looking for seed funding to build up in three areas: 1) sales and operations, 2) marketing, and 3) ui/ux and product development.",,,,,Bootstrapped,NA

Scientific and clinical studies about the topical application of nanoparticles highlight their antimicrobial and wound healing properties, underlining their ability to relieve and prevent irritations of various origins. The excellent surface/weight ratio of silver nanoparticles enhances these bactericidal/disinfectant properties, attenuating the need for antibiotics. The action of Nano-silver is based on its small size, allowing it to invade the cellular membrane of bacteria and prevent their proliferation. Based on the size, shape and surface functionalization of the particles, they can target specific microorganisms, thus providing a selective action, increasing the efficacy and user-friendliness of the product. Nano-gold, used in Liquid Gold Serum, is also a well-known delivery system found only in next-generation pharmaceuticals. NanoSanitasTM uses the power of nanotechnology to bring a fusion of meticulously engineered nanoparticles and nature’s purest ingredients.","Carefully designed and exhaustively tested, all our products undergo exhaustive testing, which include, among others, compatibility, stability, challenge, usability and performance tests, physico-chemical characterization, pre-clinical and clinical studies etc. As quality-conscious producers, we consider these necessary pre-cautions and integrate the highest safety and quality standards into our processes and products.

NanoSanitasTM is also an award-winning line. It has been awarded by Global Health & Pharma as the Best Nano-Enhanced Pet Grooming Product and by Pets Awards (bronze distinction) at the category Miscellaneous, due to its unique scientific formula and benefits.","The team is led by an award winning team of Academics. In 2015, their research experience (of more than 100 years combined) was propelled towards commercialization by 2 skilled entrepreneurs leading to the foundation of one of the three spin-off companies of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. PLiN Nanotechnology consists of skilled personnel, including scientists with degrees of higher education and marketeers with years of experience in pet grooming products. The philosophy, expertise and vision of our people is what makes us grow, succeed and be competitive with products of high quality.
Our brand strategy is to provide support and targeted marketing expertise to a wide range of professionals (groomers, veterinarians, distributors, pet shop owners) through training sessions, marketing campaigns and marketing material for product promotion (brochures, samples) and for the social media to create awareness.
The rapid growth of pet-related markets, driven by pet humanization, leads to greater expenditures by pet owners. Pet conscious ownersselect products with high quality standards, with natural ingredients and without harmful chemicals. NanoSanitasTM is designed to meet the needs of pets and their families, developing products inspired by nature and nanotechnology, promoting pet’s health and wellbeing.
","Following the success of these products on a global scale, the company received VC funding in 2018 and 2019 by the Venture Capital Uni.Fund.An investment of 750K€ was spent to develop a Premium line of pet products with an even more effective composition of Nanomaterials (Silver and now Gold), combined with nature’s purest ingredients.

The easy-to-use cloud-based platform ensures practicality and efficiency for the end-user. From September 2016, the company has managed to attract several leading shipping companies and suppliers across the market segment. More specifically, the procurement process of 1000 vessels is being handled by the system, connecting a network of more than 3,000 suppliers in all major ports around the world. Procureship provides unique features by leveraging its exceptional technological capabilities, unparalleled customer support and pioneering spirit. The company’s mission is to overcome the existing boundaries of procurement in the shipping industry and provide a dynamic online platform full of opportunities for ship owners/managers and suppliers. The company’s long-term vision stands as a fundamental driver to constantly search for new areas of improvement and to broaden its range of provided services.                                ","Procureship offers a unique solution to its client base in order to optimize the procurement process in the maritime industry. Shipping companies can easily submit multiple inquiries, by searching and selecting the most suitable suppliers recommended by our platform for each RFQ, which is achieved via real-time analysis on predetermined criteria. The internal flow monitoring process identifies cases that need to be addressed per RFQ/PO and allocates tasks to our account managers, limiting the required work of purchasers. Thus, the automation of repetitive tasks and the minimization of manual data inputs improve productivity and results.
In regards to suppliers, they can benefit from our provided marketplace as they can increase their business activities and exposure to our integrated network of shipping companies. Also, the platform effectively assists them to streamline the submission of their quotations through the integration with their systems, as well as via a parsing technology.
                                ","Procureship’s core foundations lie on the utilization of the latest technologies to provide a holistic and innovative solution to uplift the operations of our clients. Some of our platform’s key differentiating features are the following:
•Supplier recommendation engine: a unique recommendation algorithm, which leverages trading data anonymously and dynamically in order to present to shipping companies the most reliable and relevant results, in terms of the proposed suppliers for an RFQ, based on multivariate data analysis.
•E-invoicing: a digitized invoicing process, which utilizes complex machine learning techniques, parsing and recognizing all types of invoices, without the need for any specific template.
•Marketplace for service providers: relevant service providers around the world can be found via the utilization of the available advanced filters (e.g. Class Approval) and receive service-related requests.
                                ","• Even though the idea of Procureship was conceptualized in 2015, the actual product was formally launched in September 2016, where our first client, Starbulk Group, consisting of a fleet of 120 vessels, agreed to use the product.
• In September 2018 our first foreign client, Zearborn Shipmanagement, which is based in Germany and Singapore also joined our platform. This was a key partnership since it helped us expose our business activities to a wider scale and put Procureship on the European market map.
• In March 2019, the platform reached a total number of 500 vessels.
• Currently, Procureship handles the procurement process of 39 ship managers with a total of 1000 vessels, while the registered suppliers' network has reached a total number of 3000.
                                ","Procureship’s leadership consists of Mr. Lamprou, who is the company’s CEO and Head of Product Development, Mr. Manassakis who is the COO and Head of Business Development, as well as Mr. Kazakos who is the CTO and responsible for our software engineering team and the platform’s architecture. 
The Development Team’s primary activities refer to the development, testing and deployment of new features, the overall maintenance of the platform, as well as the assistance with resolving any potential technical issues of the integrated shipping companies.
The Business Department's main task includes assisting and resolving any operational issues that occur to the shipping companies under their responsibility. Additionally, each Account Manager is also assigned further specific responsibilities that may indicatively include HR and Accounting related tasks.
At the moment, 39 ship managers, with a total fleet of 1000 vessels, operate their procurement process via Procureship. Our short-term expectations refer to a 50-60% growth of our client base, while for the long-term, Procureship aspires to become a key player in the maritime e-procurement market, owning 30-40% of the market share. We consider that this is a realistic and achievable target, by taking into account our recent growth rate, as well as that this is a niche market with a limited number of rivals.

Global food supply chains ship products worldwide by linking vendors and demand over thousands of miles. Because of this multi-point transfer, it also presents the risks of contamination and/or degradation of the quality and safety of the food. Hence, consumers and other agencies (on behalf of the consumers) like regulatory authorities, or processors would like to trace the origin and the quality of food during the entire journey. They would like to know the production activities carried out, the resources used, and the impact. This requires an integrated traceability and monitoring system across the entire supply chain which would help in increased awareness, surveillance and meet the demand for safer products.","Despite that there are already some widely-adopted identification standards such as those under the GS1 organization that provides a mechanism to create globally recognized identifiers for products, these identifiers are mostly used to recognize products at the Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) level and provide no information about the food’s origins and quality. The inability to trace products in the supply chain comes from the disparate record-keeping methods in use. The widely accepted “one up, one down” (OUOD) approach—whereby food supply chain participants know only the immediate supplier (one link up the chain) and the immediate customer (one link down the chain) for a product—is simply insufficient.

Promilist is one of the first startups to be supported by the Business Incubator of the European Space Agency in Greece (ESA BIC Greece). ","In the shipping  sector, emissions simply relate to the amount and type of fuel consumed, and as we can see, CO2 emissions have been a main issue to be addressed for maritime transportation from both an economic and environmental point of view. As international organisations begin to take action to reduce the emissions of the shipping sector, large ships trading at European and global ports are obliged to monitor and report their fuel consumption, as well as opt to reduce their annual average CO2 emissions on a linear basis. 

In Promilist, we have developed a cutting-edge weather routing software (SaaS) that calculates -in a mathematically verifiable way- the best possible route for a ship to take, reducing fuel consumption and GHG emissions by up to 20% per trip. This in turn, results in savings on both fuel costs and -the upcoming- emission taxes and penalties that may also eventually increase supply chain costs. By utilising weather forecasts, vessel specific information and artificial intelligence we can optimise the vessel’s route, in real time and effectively save fuel and CO2 emissions.

So, in a nutshell, the maritime sector can  transfer commodities and function more efficiently while addressing climate change.

Finally, our project aligns with the following UN Sustainable Development Goals: Goal 12, for sustainable consumption. Goal 13, for taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.","Our innovative weather routing software finds the best possible route for a ship to take (and not just a better one in comparison with the orthodrome), in order to have the minimum fuel consumption and a timely arrival. 

Unlike other competitors and the common market practice, we don’t do linear interpolation from the grid data. We employ Neural Network Regression for the data grid and we use that for the calculations to achieve memory reduction. 
The above-mentioned approach, namely the Calculus of Variations approach, combines the analysis of Earth Observation data, artificial intelligence technology, naval engineering parameters and out-performs the currently used graph-based methods.

That ensures superior accuracy of our optimised route, as well as scalability at lower costs. In addition, our API allows us to expose the functionalities of our Neural Network to our clients, ensuring an easy integration with their existing systems, making us more personalised and extensible than the competition.

Compared with alternatives weather routing softwares, our solution: A) Is guaranteed to find the best possible route, and not just a better one, B) which in turn means optimised fuel and emissions reduction. C) Can have as much accuracy as required. D) Minimises the required “calculation” time to find the best route. E) Minimises the required hardware installation needed to run the software. F) Our service is easily extensible and scalable through our API.","So far, Promilist has been granted €50.000 by the European Space Agency, for developing software solutions that use space data and has also won the 2022 John & Mary Pappajohn Business Plan award, €4.000. Promilist has also been awarded the 1st place at “Blue Growth” category | 2nd place at “Innovation Idea Holder” on the 2021 Green Tech Challenge, and it was at the top 5 finalists in the “Robotics and AI” Category of the Imperial College London VC Challenge 2022, which was powered by Huawei. Moreover, Promilist is a member of the Hellenic Association of Space Industries and it’s being supported by German Hellenic Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and GreenTechLab. 

Finally, it is notable to mention that Promilist founders were featured by Forbes 30Under30 list in Greece.","Our founding team came together during a brainstorming session on an entrepreneurial ecosystem event. We began talking about the technical and engineering problems that the present weather routing systems have and how we can solve them.

Quadible's mission is to create a safer world while making people's lives easier so they can focus on what matters for them. Until now, organisations have mitigated risk and fraud by putting all the burden on users’ side. With the evolution of technology such as artificial intelligence, at Quadible we believe that it is time to remove that burden from end-users’ shoulders. Through transparency it is time to increase people’s trust towards innovative technologies that will remove repetitive, energy and time-consuming tasks, allowing them to focus on what is important for themselves.","Quadible introduces an AI-solution that continuously authenticates the user, without the need for any input, by learning the users’ behavioural patterns. The system combines multiple behavioural observations from which the identity of a user can be determined. The combination of different types of observations with AI and psychological models leads to an extremely high accuracy in authenticating individuals by eliminating the errors of each individual behavioural pattern. The system is far easier to use because the end-user does not have to actively do anything. While state-of-the-art approaches focused on using one biometric (fingerprint, iris, voice, face) to authenticate the users, Quadible uniquely combines more than 14 independent behavioural traits including biometrics and behavioural patterns based on movement, smartphone usage and financial transactions from people's daily life, resulting in a more secure and more user-friendly authentication system. This helps our customers reduce costs by mitigating risk and fraud and at the same time provide a better service to their customers by improving the user-experience.","Quadible provides the only system that introduces a multi-biometric self-compensating continuous authentication system that autonomously learns the users’ behavioural patterns. It is the only system that offers:
- Continuous behavioural authentication that does not require any user input.
- Authentication that uniquely combines more than 14 biometrics, human, device and transactional behavioural patterns.
- Setup with only one selfie photo or a passport.
- Primary standalone continuous authentication that fully discards passwords.
- Secondary continuous authentication discarding the need for multi-factor authentication
- PSD2 compliance without vulnerable SMS authentication factor.
- Device ubiquity, one profile across all the users' devices.

Quadible is focusing on offering a competitive product that provides a more secure and easy-to-use authentication solution.

Our co-founders collectively have more than 40 years of complementary expertise in neurodegeneration. Supporting our core therapeutic R&D efforts, are parallel programmes focused on filling a critical gap in sensitive “biomarker” tools that allow more precise tracking of disease progression and, importantly, the early identification of high-risk individuals, to initiate treatment before the emergence of symptoms - when there is the greatest chance of therapeutic success.","In order to achieve our goal, we believe that the drug discovery process should be linked to the development of novel biomarker tools that aid in our ability to identify and track patients who will benefit most from therapy. Our solution is to generate a therapeutic pipeline by identifying, validating and advancing promising new candidates that have the potential to halt or slow the progression of Parkinson's Disease. Our lead hit is showing great effectiveness in blocking the biological pathways of cell death in our preclinical models. 

In addition, we are developing sensitive tests for early detection, diagnosis and tracking progression of disease over time. For this, we have designed a multiplex ELISA-based ultra-sensitive biomarker assay that simultaneously measures different target proteins in various clinical samples, and a sensitive biomarker assay based on a novel PET tracer ligand, that targets the pathological proteins in the diseased brain before the appearance of symptoms.
We believe that developing tools such as biomarker assays as well as PET tracer ligands, while also stand-alone revenue generating products, serve to boost both the effectiveness as well as the value of our therapeutic pipeline. 
","Parkinson's Disease is the fastest growing neurodegenarative disease, affecting approximately 10M people worldwide. By the time an individual is diagnosed, more than 50% of the dopaminergic neurons that help control our movement are lost. Aside from the impact of the disease on patients and their caregivers, there is an enormous economic burden, both in terms of direct medical costs and indirect costs. The annual economic burden of PD is more than $50B in the US alone.
There are no disease-modifying therapies that can block or slow the progressive degeneration in the CNS that characterises PD. In addition, there are even fewer options for early detection of high-risk individuals who would benefit from initiation of treatment earlier, at the first signs of neurodegeneration. 
Our initial therapeutic target involves a gene (LRRK2) commonly linked to familial and sporadic PD. Although its genetic link to PD represents about 1% of all cases, making it the most common genetic cause, there is strong evidence linking it to most forms of the disease – therefore making this protein a potentially blockbuster therapeutic target. Our approach is focusing only on the pathologic action of this gene, leaving its normal function intact. 

Our ultimate goal is to partner with an established global pharmaceutical company with the infrastructure and reach to help transition our pre-clinical R&D activities to clinical trials and ultimately to the largest pool of potential patients.



","Upon its establishment, in June 2019, Anacalypsis Therapeutics was accepted into the 7th round of the EGG enter-grow-go programme startup accelerator, a Eurobank CSR Initiative. Following this, in January 2021, Anacalypsis Therapeutics joined the ScaleUp program at EGG. In November 2022, we successfully applied for our first patent and in February of 2023 we will have submitted our second provisional patent application. At the start of 2023, we established our first private lab and established our first partnership agreement with Columbia University to use our unique biomarker tools to test patient and preclinical samples.","Our founding team has worked together in an academic research setting (BRFAA; Athens, Greece) for more than 10 years in the Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Diseases. Our CEO, Alexia Polissidis, PhD is a psychopharmacologist who established  the Neurobehavioural Phenotyping facility at BRFAA and is an independently-funded Junior Team Leader; and Hardy Rideout, the CSO, has built a deep, internationally-recognized, expertise in neurodegenerative diseases. We are further supported by four brilliant Advisors on our Board of Directors and four Scientific Advisors (clinicians and basic researchers) for both Greece and the US.

Why Us? Rather than attempt to block all activity of a target protein implicated in Parkinson's disease, including its normal function, we have identified a unique interaction with another protein that induces cell death and a highly specific approach to disrupt this toxic protein complex. This way, the normal activity of this protein is preserved. Our patient-centric approach has the potential to change the way we see and treat patients with neurodegenerative diseases, since our synergistic approach to biomarker-drug development boosts chances of identifying earlier high-risk patients and begin treatment before neurodegeneration becomes inevitable.","Our funding strategy for the next few years is focused on completing the development of our initial lead therapeutic, as well as our companion biomarker and PET products. Our early financing came in the form of F&F/bootstrapping, and was dedicated almost entirely to the initial IP costs associated with our provisional application for the multiplexed biomarker assay. Next, the current funding we are seeking, our Seed round of approximately 2M €, will be dedicated to completion of the development of our biomarker and PET tracer, and importantly for the completion of the pre-clinical studies assessing the efficacy of our lead hit. Subsequently, we will seek a larger Series A round which will be dedicated to continuing our pre-clinical studies of the therapeutic candidate, expanding our pipeline, scientific and administrative hires, expansion of our IP portfolio, and critically – establishment of our private laboratory space.

We have developed a novel laser light source that can stimulate the retina with spatial selectivity. We plan to use this source for two devices addressing two different markets: (a) biometrics, and (b) medical diagnostics. Regarding biometrics, we have designed a novel biometric identification scheme using few photons and relying on the visual system's ability to perform photon counting. This scheme is called ""quantum biometrics"" and is poised to offer unprecedented security agains malicious attacks. Our light source is used to stimulate the retina with few photons and thus initiate the identification protocol relying on the differences of low intensity light perception among humans. Regarding medical diagnostics, we have used the same light source with higher light intensity, to measure the pupil's light reflex. This is the process of pupil constriction and re-dilation at the presence of light illumination and its termination, respectively. The process is regulated by neural circuits in the mid-brain. Since we can stimulate the retina at several different spots, we can extract new neural information from the pupil's spatially selective response. The extracted information is potentially very useful for diagnosing disease of the retina and the central nervous system.","Our innovation is based on the use of ""surgically"" precise experimental techniques regarding the manipulation of light to study aspects of the human visual system.

Hospitality 
Market:  Hotels & STR, have come to realize, that the two biggest operating they needed to manage, is energy and access control. Radefy identified a gap in the market, which was missing a unified solution that would combine both automated access control, electric mgmt. and remote management of all properties under one easy to use screen, quickly, easily and affordably. 

Travel market:  
Travel is a complex and high anxiety purchase. This is because travel information is scattered in different websites which lack proper travel content, making planning and booking a trip a fragmented process. Compiling travel information and putting it in a map is time consuming. The mass penetration of Smartphones has created new travel shopping processes, with Travelers demanding faster access to information and more customized experiences during their vacations.  This trend is expected to grow faster due to the growing entrance of the Millennials in the market.  It is expected that by 2025 Millennials will account for 75% of all international tourist arrivals, demanding end-to-end online travel planning, local experiences and last minute bookings. Radefy has identified this market shift and is designing a next generation AI driven Digital Concierge cloud platform and mobile app, that will solve all traveler pain points.","Hospitality Market:
To cover this market gap and provide a solution to the customers pain points, we designed a scalable and fully integrated cloud-based platform, which in cooperation with our proprietary IoT device and BLE Locks, unified both automated Guest Access and Electric Mgmt.  From  the Dashboard, a customer can easily issue/delete and automatically send personal e-keys to his Guests, set operating parameters for all connected electric devices in his rental properties and monitor his business remotely from anywhere in the world. Using our Energy & Access Mgmt. cloud platform, hotels and STR can now manage their costs more efficiently. Existing customers have seen a 20% reduction in their electric consumption.

Travel market:  
To resolve this conundrum, we are developing the next generation AI driven Digital Concierge App, that will offer an End-to-End Travel Cycle Experience with a One-Stop-Shop offering a frictionless experience. Travelers will use our Digital Guest Book to research the City they wish to visit, discover the city’s vibes and discover its cultural & archeological treasures and local experiences, buy/reserve local products/services which will automatically be updated in the in-app map and their in -app itinerary.  Our AI “Jake” will be at their side through the entire Travel cycle experience to guide them, offer answers to their questions, make reservations and update their itinerary.
","Radefy is a truly innovative startup.

Hospitality Market:
It first addressed customers pain points, by designing and developing its Centurion cloud-based platform, its Avaton IoT Device and its BLE Locks, providing customers with the ability to fully manage their two biggest operating costs at a very low price. There is 2 hours installation process but after that the service is immediately available.  Currently we are in the process of introducing to the market additional Smart Hospitality devices, integrated with our cloud platform, in order to reduce installation time and move further ahead from our competitors before they realize the market need.

•tBusiness Model, Product/Service: Subscription business model 
•tStrapline: No more high electric bills! No more keys! No more endless waiting for your Guests to arrive! 
•tValue Proposition: Save Time, Save Money stay profitable

Travel market:  
The AI driven Digital Concierge App, is a completely new and innovative concept.  As an app it is extremely scalable on a global level, offering a frictionless experience to travelers in 21 languages.  
Our Business model is a multisided platform business model, as it connects travelers (demand) with local suppliers of products/services (supply), in order to offer travelers a customized travel experience and suppliers an additional source of clientele and income.  Once Travelers sets up their account and enter their credit card, they will enjoy a completely frictionless experience.

Thus far, we have completed six (6) important milestones: 
1. Completed Concept and Product Testing 
2. Completed the development of a Prototype 
3. Completed Initial Product/Service Tests 
4. We completed Market Testing 
5. We started Production 
6. We completed a bellwether sale In July 2020 
We booked our first major account, a luxury suite chain operating in the center of Athens with 240 newly built rooms. To win this customer over, we had to compete against ASSA ABLOY a €1.5 billion Swedish giant. The customer selected us due to the innovative unified solution we offered compared to our competitor, the ease in installation and our very competitive pricing model. COVID-19 and the hospitality lockdown imposed led to  almost two years of being commercially inactive.  However, since the end of 2021, commercial activity has picked up very strongly, company recognition in the market is growing fast and as a result in a very short period of time we have managed to service 350 rental units with a plan to reach 500 by the end of 2022 with expected revenue in excess of €150.000.

A headless CMS for large organizations and web agencies. Our product provides innovative technological solutions in the headless CMS space.

It follows a 100% serverless architecture. Meaning that our clients don’t need to invest in infrastructure to use our product. These are some of the core features:

- Advance Content delivery and distribution though Edge Caching and REST Apis
- Innovative localization experience. Allowing international companies to localize their content in flexible ways.
- Media management and manipulation.
- Team and organization management.
- Data isolation and on demand scalability
- White-label features, allowing web agencies to re-license our product
- Integration with popular service such as MongoDB, AWS, Azure Cloud, ElasticSearch.
- Deep graph database model, ideal for eCommerce apps
- And much more","A great innovation of our product is that our customers are free to use their technology of choice to connect to any of the “heads”. Once the content is ready developers can load it to a website, mobile app, or other channel. Due to the separated nature of the headless CMS, our customers can choose the technologies that fit their current architecture. 

Our competitive advantages are Personalization, Localization & Security.
Personalization and Localization allow content editors to deliver future-proof digital experiences. Our customers can easily unlock new revenue sources, reaching a global audience because we offer full localization support and a translation workflow for all types of content and assets.

Security is a major deciding factor when it comes to choosing a CMS for a business. Our platform protects against security risks due to its decoupled nature. Our API can also provide content distribution that is read-only. Additionally, that API can be placed behind an application and a security layer.

Finally, an important innovation is the way we bill our customers. Most, if not all, of our competitor follow the standard subscription package per website. After analysis and discussion with our customers, we concluded that “taxing” the horizontal growth is counter-intuitive for most businesses. On the other hand, vertically billing based on usage is fairer and allows our customers to have flexibility when reselling our product or planning to expand their business.","We have released 3 major versions of our product, evolving according to our customer needs and the global direction of our industry.
2018: we reached our first milestone of 50 subscribed customers to our service, a decent number for us because it is a B2B and not a consumer product.
2019: we established partnerships with 4 important Greek agencies, which used our platform to develop applications and websites for their customers (telecommunication companies, large retail stores and supermarkets).
2020: we see our product as the main system to manage a quiz game for kids and we scaled our product to serve an average of 5 million requests per day.
2021: a Greek startup, choose our product to develop their marketplace. They use our product to cover, product content, blog, newsletter, promotion and loyalty content needs. Also, we have acquired as a customer a company based in Florida, expanding our services worldwide. This company uses our product to unify their international content needs.","The founders of Lucent CMS, me (Alexander) and Elvira have a long history of working on the web.

Our mission is also to bring sophisticated and usually out-of-reach sleep analysis to more people and to help them identify potential health issues. Our application will present an affordable and easy way to track your sleep and get important information. Also, when professional care is needed, the users will be notified. Healthcare professionals with the use of our dashboard have the possibility of long-term surveillance of their patients’ health status. Doctors will be able to retrieve information about their patients’ habits and daily activities for many weeks before, something unheard of before. Detection and identification of symptoms, contribute to finding underlying health issues and then based on the doctor’s assessment further and refined testing can be ordered.","By using off-the-shelf devices and developing a sophisticated and advanced application we give the opportunity to everyday people to accurately monitor their sleep quality. Sleep is a complex issue affecting and being affected by many habits of our daily lives. Therefore, we are following a holistic approach, which is different from what our competitors are doing in terms that we are collecting and using a multitude of data and information from the users and their daily lives; we do not limit our analysis only on data collected during sleep, as our competitors do. We are taking advantage not only of the high computational power of modern hardware, but also the potential of AI algorithms to process vast amount of information. 
Additionally, by coupling the application with a platform designed for doctors and medical professionals, we can offer unique solutions. Long-term patient surveillance for instance can allow doctors monitor their patients’ health status after a major procedure or whether a new medication has altered and improved their habits. The platform will also offer in the future automated symptom detection, the medical professionals will then be notified and be able to review the full analysis that led to this conclusion. 
These features differentiate us from all competitors we have identified so far.
","So far, the team of Raivotech has developed a functioning application, which can collect data from fitness trackers and smartphones of the most popular manufacturers. The application is currently undergoing internal testing and will be soon released to the public for further testing. 
In parallel, the web dashboard for professionals is being developed. Direct communication with medical professionals provides us with feedback about it, which is then implemented into the design and functionality of the dashboard. 
We have been accepted by Patras Science Park to use their facilities as our office spaces, giving us many opportunities for networking and participation in many events, one of them being the Orange Grove incubator.

Fragile egos, miscommunication, lack of transparency and poor timing are considered among the different challenges teams face, ending up blocking the employees’ growth. But why do teams need it? Because structured and organized feedback can definitely increase effectiveness, measure productivity and better engage team members. Why do project managers and companies need it? To get the best out of their teams, to set goals and objectives based on quantitative and qualitative results and even receive guidance on the next steps of their projects. In REBORRN, we believe that there is a way to get regular and valuable feedback that still remains fun and can take less than 4’. So, we combined our Product, Organizational and Data expertise to create a spin-off digital product, “The Pulser”, to face those challenges.","Aspiring to foster this feedback mentality within teams, we created the Pulser. It’s a pretty simple tool designed to catch structured, regular, teams-oriented feedback, with an actual impact on the ways they shape their collaboration. We are based on 4 main principles:
Teams come first: We care about making teamwork more efficient and happier. Project progress tracking is also a positive side-effect. 
Quickly but frequently: Regular feedback is definitely better than just feedback. So, we choose a super-fast and consistent process but in frequent periods of time.
Promoting transparency: We respect anonymity, but we give the team the chance to do the extra mile and turn their answers to eponymous at any time!
Getting useful insights: Project owners orchestrate the process with their teams and we ensure they get useful insights, clear outcomes, quantitative and qualitative results and even next steps suggestions. Insights that they can share with their team members anytime.
","Most project management tools track project status from the perspective of task completion, and yes, this is very important but it lacks insights on the underlying reasons (e.g is the team happy? What is keeping us back? What went well? Is our client satisfied? Could we have done better?). Also, most teams rely on the project managers’ view only, rather than on their collective wisdom. On the other hand, there are many solutions out there that track employee engagement, however they don’t connect this feedback with a specific process or project.
The Pulser’s unique value proposition is the combination of a great user experience that makes the most out of the team’s insights, and a well thought reporting interface to support the project managers using predictive analytics and simulation modelling. Users can give feedback smoothly, quickly, in a fun and engaging way, using emojis, answering surprise questions, getting reactions from their project managers on comments and answers. On the other side, admins can easily set pulses frequency and interpret data and answers. They can compare pulses between teams or types of projects, people, time periods, create shareable reports to increase transparency, identify correlations, e.g. person’s performance per project, per team, react instantly, identify next steps and engage with their teams. We created a feedback tool that matches perfectly to all projects or teams. All in all, it’s design led, data backed, beautifully engineered. ","The Pulser was the outcome of our need to find a friendly tool to improve our  ways of working and collaboration as a team. We started with the development of Phase A, including 5 easy-to-answer questions and the detailed admin’s interface. A phase that we completed in a month and released the product in September. We tested internally once a week with our agile teams and with some of our clients to achieve some initial market validation. 
The team’s appetite for more features brought on Phase B in December. We added new features and totally redesigned the reporting interface. We reached out to market, attracting more free clients aiming to establish a Product-Market fit.
We are currently developing Phase C, proceeding with the redesign of the whole Administration Interface and the addition of new app features, like onboarding screens for new users and profile pages for all the reviewers. ","We love to describe The Pulser as the brand new, pocket-size, team retrospectives’ little brother. So every team out there, even the tiniest one, could be a potential user. We know that time and engagement are our main advantages in regards to any other feedback collection process, so we are confident enough to say that the tool has a high growth potential to any market and sector.
Among our competitors we could point out the all-inclusive people operations platforms since many companies prefer a single point of truth when it comes to organizational design. Although The Pulser is a self-serve product, it may require heavy support and human resources from our side until the habit of giving feedback sticks in its potential users. In addition, we see a lot of future costs in two different areas: firstly, in customer acquisition and secondly, in the fast product growth in order to accommodate more user needs.","RBN SAT has been bootstrapped so far, using an initial personal investment and then using its own revenues. We are looking for funding opportunities to increase our team size.

We have developed the first-of-its-kind Smart Scale that enables sorting, boosts employees' engagement and provides real-time data about facility and employees’ overall recycling performance in any office facility. The product incorporates a customized technology of Smart -connected to the cloud- Scales and user identification technology. In this manner, Recytrust assists companies to manage their recycling waste effectively, and at the same time generates revenue for businesses by enabling them to auction off their generated waste volumes to a certified network of collectors, while providing traceability for all parties involved through Smart Contracts on Blockchain.

Recytrust acts as waste brokers who could help ease the burden of companies, businesses & organizations, by providing a few key services: managing day-to-day interactions with waste haulers, and leveraging the combined purchasing power of the broker’s multiple customers to obtain better pricing for each. That enables even small, local suppliers to bid on the individual outlets of large companies. Apparently, cost reduction drives Recytrust' business model. Recytrust is an asset-light waste and recycling company focused on sustainability. Our customers are primarily in the retail, food service and hospitality industries and the heavy industrial sector. ","Compared with the current state of the art in the market, Recytrust has no match offering unique value-added services (VAS) able to attract both new customers and investing schemes. Our competitive strategy includes building our own product portfolio, and using that to leverage mutually-beneficial partnerships. Since Recytrust is an asset-light company (it owns no waste trucks), it's focused on cost reduction- renegotiating contracts, adjusting frequency of pickups and increase margin profits for its clients. 
We essentially handle all of our business customers' waste needs, and as we find ways to reduce the waste, we share the savings back with our customers. We will primarily focus on direct sales and online marketing exposure to identify and pursue businesses that are waste generators and demonstrate the value of our solution, such as providing transparency and measurable visualization, sustainability reporting, and opportunities for cost savings/revenue creation. A targeted willingness to pay (WTP) survey we have already conducted settled on the use of a one-time gate-fee of 250euros per scale plus a monthly subscription fee of 5euros per scale, to allow businesses to maintain platform access and visualize metrics in real-time. In addition, we will charge Certified Collectors 10euros/ton as a prepaid deposit in their digital wallet to be able to participate in the e-auction service.","Recytrust has created a groundbreaking patented technology that utilizes IoT, Smart Contracts on blockchain technology, data analytics and mobile app, to create transparency, efficiency, accountability, and increased profitability for businesses and recycling collectors. 

IoT technology: Recytrust designed and developed the first-of-its-kind internet-connected digital weight scale that can be placed underneath any recycling bin to monitor weight at any given time. The hardware is also integrated with an RFID access control, to identify users and monitor their recycling performance.

Mobile App: Recytrust is the first matching platform, where businesses that generate streams of recyclables connect with recycling collectors to dramatically lower costs and increase profits for both parties. Recytrust’ Uber-like App is providing an optimal driving route in real-time, vehicle tracking and real-time positioning, navigation, and alerts while collecting real-time metrics on the measured weight of recyclables to be picked up.

Focusing on maritime operations, we have found that several ancillary plastic products are not being disposed in a sustainable manner once they reach their end of life. Prime examples include mooring ropes and fishing nets, which come with technological as well as logistical challenges when it comes to their sustainable disposal. The lack of interest from companies to take on this challenge has led to harmful disposal of such products through land-filling, incineration and even sea-dumping. Additionally, tight regulations on legal rope conditions result in excessive amounts of plastic waste from these sources yearly. The harm these disposal methods cause to the environment through carbon emissions and particularly the marine environment, through the disruption of entire ecosystems, cannot be ignored any longer.

At Reelease, we are developing a pipeline for re-cycling and more importantly up-cycling these waste streams into useful products. Our solutions will create a green incentive in favor of the recycling process and promote the sustainable treatment of plastic maritime waste in order to accommodate the growing industry and aid the way to healthier, plastic-free seas.","At Reelease we are researching how to efficiently and sustainably separate individual materials from multi-material ropes into pure, high-quality plastics to be used as feedstock back in the production process. Since our inception in 2021, we have been working closely with recycling experts and research institutes in order to explore different approaches for initially recycling and moving onwards upcycling these products; effectively adding value to the processed material.

Our recycling research has as prime objectives the scalability of the project, purity and low-cost both economically and environmentally, while we also strongly believe that the choice to recycle can be incentivized by providing useful products back to our customers.  To that end, we are experimenting with modern manufacturing technologies to give a new revolutionary life to these waste streams.

Supported by our growing network of partners we embrace the challenge and are aiming to make re/up cycling of the target maritime products a streamlined process that is both an affordable and rewarding choice for our customers.

","The problem we are trying to solve is both technical but also very much logistical in nature:

1) Technology: Observing a gap in recycling solutions and the technology used to separate different fiber materials from products such as mooring ropes, we are developing a process for extracting the plastic constituents from such products. While semi-sustainable solutions to the mooring rope problem have already been achieved by Reelease, there exists no further innovation, globally, that challenges the fully-sustainable and  high-quality output standards that Reelease has set on achieving.

2) Logistics: In order to secure recycling interest as well as a steady supply of raw material, we have already established ever-growing channels in the maritime industry ranging from shipping companies, port authorities and fishing entities operating on a global scale. 
While based in Greece and with a global reach of customers, our technology has the potential to be distributed globally and be scaled-up to accommodate the recycling needs of major port hubs, effectively minimizing transportation costs.

Through our actions we plan on giving maritime companies an incentive to choose recycling over cheap harmful disposal, but to also encourage port authorities to introduce greener disposal operations.
","Reelease has already completed several recycling cycles, resulting in the research and production of end-products for use in the transportation industry. This provided us with a Proof of Concept (POC), demonstrating the feasibility of the recycling process.

Additionally, in collaboration with leading research and academic institutes, we are  conducting tests and experiments in order to find the optimal solution for our customers that can accommodate the range of products that we might encounter. We are confident that innovative R&D will allow us to reach our goal, which would be groundbreaking in the maritime recycling industry.

Furthermore, we have already established various collaborations with leading shipping companies, mooring ropes manufacturers and others in order to continuously provide us with significant quantities of mooring ropes as well as fishing nets, for our R&D purposes and recycling purposes.","Our team contains a multi-disciplinary combination of both young and passionate members possessing extensive knowledge in the shipping sector, specializing from the operations to the technical departments, with backgrounds ranging from mechanical and marine engineering to IT, Material Science and Robotics from leading universities in Europe.

The concept is to deliver farms of any size through emerging technologies such as EO (Earth Observation), IoT, AI and BDA (Big Data Analytics) or manually. Beyond software development REFARM is engaged in exploiting latest technologies in Robotics and Nanomaterials in the Farming sector. We are engaging 3 test sites as living laboratories. These test beds are in suburban or remote areas examining autonomy for water, energy and crop efficiency.

","The main idea is to provide turn on Key solutions along the overall cultivation process. From the start of selecting appropriate cultivation for a particular field, up to consumption and beyond, towards recycling and potential exploitation of waste. For commercial farming, we can automate selection and packaging ready for distribution and recycling. We can make everything automatically. One of our main competences is to follow up evolutions in emerging technologies (EO, AI, IoT, BDA). Without creating dependencies on any other external factor, we utilise the most recent and advanced technologies and incorconnect them through our AI platform. We can automate unique parts, several parts or everything that constitute the elements of a farming enterprise. 
Utilizing experience, advanced technologies and infrastructures, we identify and implement ways to optimize production for personal or commercial use. We propose ways to optimize further any part of any process from cultivation, to yield, to logistics and to recycling. In an ideal situation farmers wouldn’t need to do anything. But because nature is unpredictable we cooperate with local farmers and agriculturists to prepare yunexperienced farmers through training and continuous support, so as to minimize their operating efforts, as much as possible. ","Depending on several factors, such as the type of ccultivation, the number of labour (stable and extra according to the seasonal needs), the microclimatic characteristics and more, we design, operate and predict upcoming uncertainties and demands of a partiqular farm. Even small fields of less than 4.000 m2 deliver enough farming space to feed a family with organic vegetables, livestock and fruit. In case of inexperienced farmers, we can create an Auto and Robo Farm Model (ARFM) to do anything for them. On the far end we can provide our services for extensive types and combinations of cultivations. Yield depends on microclimate and land. We propose cultivations depending on this concept, farmers needs and the market. We adapt the farm to local needs and incorporate added value with niche products keeping in mind historical cultivations. At first we give a brief report suggesting what would be appropriate for a field and potential ways to produce and recycle. Depending on choices we can fully automate all processes with the option to exploit the benefits of manually turn. We give emphasis on organic pharming and we provide solution on micro farming and urban farming for specialised, ad-hoc farming needs for restaurants through small gardens. The situation is simpler for vast areas of unique cultivations like cotton or grain fields. There we can automate evreything working on 24/7/365 basis.

items from others or rent-out their own. In a single phrase, we could be characterized as the ""Airbnb'' for items. In essence, we are looking to establish an online marketplace that bridges the gap between the supply and demand of rental items. Renthis2me has received grants of 15K Euros.

Our customers can be segregated into two broad categories, the renters and the owners. Owners would use our platform in order to gain smart money from temporarily shelved products that they own also, owners would typically be individuals but in some cases could even be rental shops in need of an extra source of revenue. Renters would be young people, those looking to live new experiences to the fullest, such as a vacation or a party, through the procurement of certain products, such as speakers or ski equipment. 

Our Vision is to create a world where everything is for share, a world where everything belongs to you.
We want to change consumers' habits and face overconsumption.
Our Mission is to achieve that money does not be an obstacle to human wishes. 
","We offer a platform that facilitates the act of borrowing and lending items between two parties. Our role in this interaction is purely that of the intermediary. Firstly, we provide the digital space in which this transaction occurs. Secondly, we aid in the establishment of trust in any rental transaction. Lastly, our responsibilities include ensuring that timely delivery and return of items is carried out successfully.","The rental of such items these days can be achieved only through the use of rental shops (direct competitor) or by exchanging items with close friends (indirect competitor). When compared to our solution, rental shops are more inflexible both in terms of the variety of items they can supply and their ability to scale up. These limitations stem from the fact that in this business model the rental shops are also in fact the suppliers. This means that they face: 

A) Higher capex costs in terms of the product procurement and storage.
B) Further costs in the form of a physical store.

 The higher risks associated with that process often translate to rental shops specialising only in a certain market segment. In addition, these factors also contribute to a higher difficulty of scaling up, with many rental shops operating only locally/regionally. In contrast, our solution provides an aggregated view of available items across all market segments in a single place that can be easily filtered based on area, cost, and availability of the requested item.
","We follow the lean start-up approach, we began to explore the market from two questionnaires. After the results, we decided to play with piggy backing strategy. Piggybacking strategy is when you use a platform with traction to gain customers from it. So we uploaded our items and equipment for rent at the Facebook marketplace and Xrysi Eykairia to validate if people want to rent items from a stranger. In the aftermath, we created our social media at Facebook(1.100 likes), Instagram(285 followers), and Linkedin (28 followers) and make some sales to validate again our idea. At this moment we run a pre-launch campaign and we have 250 registers on the landing page who are ready to be customers when our platform is ready. ","Our team consists of two founders.

A core aspect of the Industry 4.0 revolution for overall manufacturing efficiency is Predictive Maintenance. Experts depending on the actual condition data, collected by sensors, are forecasting the future state of the equipment and perform maintenance tasks only when warranted, long before any fault actually occurs. The cost reduction and productivity increase are impressive and stimulate a high demand for a smart factory model. 

The seemingly simple deployment of sensors is in practice a cumbersome problem. It
involves detailed preplanning, many kilometers of sensitive cables, and service crews working in harsh labor conditions to install and afterward monitor and repair damages from accidents, etc. Vast data interpretation in real-time on the other hand requires highly skilled expert personnel. 

A business opportunity exists for an almost plug-and-play solution that would neither use cables nor need experts to interpret vast data in real-time.","LoRaWAN, an open technology, for long-range low-energy wireless communication can be a solution for the spreading of condition monitoring but the low bandwidth leads to a new requirement: edge computing. So the evaluation must be performed locally and only the diagnosis transmitted to the control room. 

The product we develop is W.I.S.D.O.M. (Wireless Information System Data On Maintenance), a predictive maintenance system for industrial equipment, with integrated machine learning and artificial intelligence, operating over a long-range tended wireless network.

WISDOM comprises a wireless smart vibrations sensor kit and its accompanying management software. It is compact, battery-powered, and installed on the equipment, processing the vibrations profile and transmitting periodically the diagnosis. Vibration analysis was chosen as it can spot a problem earlier than any other method.","Our innovation lies in the combination of cutting-edge M2M, AI, LorAWAn in a unified hardware-software solution for a system that measures, interprets, diagnoses, and decides the course of action without any human intervention.

There is a group of close to 100 diseases called Protein Misfolding Diseases, which are related to the inappropriate folding of specific proteins. It includes major diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s and Type 2 diabetes, as well as other diseases (ALS, Amyloidosis, Huntington’s, etc) that affect fewer people but their consequences are devastating. Most of these diseases have no cure at the moment; hence, finding drugs for them constitutes a huge unmet medical need. The global drug discovery market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 8.54% between 2019 and 2027 and generate revenue of $83.2 billion by 2027. ResQ Biotech is an early-stage drug discovery and development company aspiring to become a partner of choice for every Pharma & Biotech company that is developing drugs for protein misfolding diseases and looking for new assets to expand their pipelines. ","We exploit the tremendous power of biotechnology to advance the early-stage drug discovery process. We have generated genetically engineered bacterial cells that synthesize hundreds of millions to billions of molecules and simultaneously screen them for their ability to fix the problematic folding of target proteins. Our technology enables us to carry out the initial steps of drug discovery in a super-fast, easy and cheap way. The enormous number of molecules that we can study improves the probability of discovering an effective drug candidate. The category of molecules we develop (small cyclic peptides) are a new drug category that have not been extensively studied, thus providing a better chance for a clean IP landscape. The technology can be used to discover molecules for a large number of diseases. Our products are candidate molecules/drugs against protein misfolding diseases which will be licensed to larger pharmaceutical companies who want to enrich their pipelines, initiate clinical trials and pursue drug approval.  ","To increase the effectiveness of early drug discovery, we have engineered bacteria to function as a stand-alone, living discovery platform for drugs rescuing disease-related protein misfolding. In this technology, large combinatorial libraries containing up to tens of billions of small, drug-like cyclic peptides are biosynthesized in E. coli cells and simultaneously screened for their ability to rescue pathogenic protein misfolding. This technology offers crucial advantages: 
1. Peptides can combine the  
2. It investigates libraries with enormous diversities and increases the chances for identifying molecules with the desired properties.
3. It produces and screens previously untested molecules and yields new bioactive molecular entities without IP restrictions. 
4. The initial discovery process is carried out in a simple bacterium - thus, its simplicity, speed and low cost are unprecedented. 
5. It is a platform technology and can be widely applicable to many different PMDs, thus allowing a constantly expandable pipeline and scalability.",We have received awards in prestigious start-up competitions in Greece and abroad.

The revenue manager manually updates the prices based on market dynamics, such as demand and competitors’ rates. Due to the high number of variables that are correlated with the market rates, this approach leaves enough room for pricing mistakes and missed opportunities. Especially small- and medium-sized hoteliers, who lack the essential financial resources, experience such issues as they try to implement a pricing room policy on their own, which constitutes a challenging task that requires a lot of time and resources for the hotel. Our company offers an automated pricing process and suggests the optimal price for a room or a property, saving time and resources for hotel and VR managers.


","RevApp is offering a machine learning room pricing tool, currently focusing on small and mid-sized hoteliers and vacation rentals’ managers that will allow them to capture any missed profits by maximizing their revenues and reducing their fixed costs and time allocated to this task. Our model, which takes into account demand, occupancy level, lead time, property, room and market characteristics, competition and seasonality, implements machine learning techniques in order to perform dynamic pricing and suggest an optimal renting price, which is automatically filled in the Property Management System. This way, our tool saves substantial time and helps the customer to make more accurate real-time pricing decisions in order to convert the page visitor into a guest.","2020 has been a challenging year for hospitality with the pandemic reducing revenues by 95% in USA and Europe. Hence, the vast majority of hotels and vacation rental (VR) managers have turned to smart hospitality approaches such as channel management software and automatic communication tools. Specifically, there is a rapid adoption of such approaches with forecasts that in 2026, they will constitute a €37.6bn industry (from €6.6bn in 2018). RevApp is part of this sector and solves a highly important problem of hotels and VR managers (i.e., the automatic pricing of their rooms). During the CapsuleT accelerator program, we found out that many Greek hotels are interested in such a pricing tool, with only a few of them using one already. Hence we believe that our growth potential is very significant both in the Greek and the global markets. Of course there are numerous challenges to this. First, we need to acquire significant capital that will allow us to adopt an aggressive marketing approach with capital injections during the first two years too. Second, talent acquisition is another barrier. Our tool is highly innovative and its implementation required significant knowledge and expertise of modern technologies. Our team has complementary skills and has been able to develop our tool within house and with the collaboration of four freelancers. Nonetheless, the acquisition of highly talented individuals that will help us expand in many markets constitutes a challenging task.","We started working on this idea about a year ago. We initially gathered data from the properties of Alexandros and his company ToStay in order to develop an initial algorithm for our product. In May we secured 15,000 as pre-seed funding from EIT Digital Venture (in exchange for 5% in equity) and became part of its accelerator program. Next, we joined Egg's incubator program and in July we developed a fully functional Minimum Viable Product for the area of Attiki. In August we created the company, based in Athens and we also shared this product with several potential customers, acquired their feedback and secured six letters of intent. In September we became part of CapsuleT accelerator program. During the past two months, we tested our product in a hotel in Athens with very promising results (i.e., the revenues were increased by around 45%) and we discuss to test it in four other hotels too. We also became part of the programs Greek Startup Universe and chosen (among more than 200 other companies) as one of the 20 startups for the final round of the Aceler@tech Program in Portugal. In May we launched our product and we have two paying customers and 13 users to whom we offer our product as a free trial for one month. We have also established collaborations with one Property Management System company, two tour operators and several other startups.","Alexandros Toulias, our CEO, is an expert in real estate and hospitality finance, having worked for GE Capital and founded two companies in the past, ToStay and Arura. He holds a BA and an MSc in Civil Engineering from NTUA and an MSc in Real Estate Development from Columbia University. Emmanouil Avgerinos, our COO, has extensive experience in data analysis and optimization. He is a tenured Associate Professor of Decision Sciences in the area of Operations and Technology at IE Business School.

Katerina Skroumpelou, our CTO, is an expert in software engineering with Web Technologies and Cloud Services. She holds a BA and an MSc in Architectural Engineering from NTUA and an MRes on Spatial Data Analysis from University College London.

There are currently four main competitors. Our main competitive advantage include: 1. Incorporating user reinforcement learning in our model, something which is not met in any of our competitors. 2. Focusing initially more on small and mid-sized hotels and vacation rental companies, which makes our approach more targeted on their needs. 3. Using a highly sophisticated model, making our approach more efficient. 4. Starting by focusing on Greece and then expanding in international cities, which makes our approach more local-based and effective.

In this light, it has developed the Energy-as-a-Service platform, a swappable battery network for inland waterway and coastal shipping electric ships that makes sure that vessel owners have the clean energy they need, when they need it at a competitive price. 

Regarding the urban mobility sector, Rhoé has already developed the Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Plans in 42 Greek municipalities, among them the municipality of Thessaloniki and many municipalities of Athens, by developing algorithms that allow private and public organizations to easily determine the optimal location, pricing, and overall EV infrastructure strategy dynamically, while it is currently a partner in OPTIMUS project, a comprehensive solution for charging station management, that enables charging station operators, consultants, and beneficiaries to optimize the performance of their networks.

- SIMPLI.CITI, NATURAL.GAS, EN.ERGY","Rhoé makes the adoption of more sustainable solutions profitable. It also makes developing sustainable products easier, faster, and more cost-effective, as it is an expert at converting sustainable transportation solutions into financially sustainable ones as well. This is precisely the difficulty we face in this era of green transition: making the adoption of sustainable solutions profitable (since the environmental factor on its own it is not enough for businesses and governments to attempt the transition). Rhoé does that by integrating in-depth transportation and energy knowledge with bleeding-edge IT technologies. It uses optimization metrics and algorithms, trained on real-world data, that facilitate the transition to greener forms of energy by catalyzing crucial barriers that so far exist.

The decarbonization of the transport sector is essential, as it contributes to almost a quarter of Europe’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Europe prioritizing the green transition, has established the Green Deal, a roadmap to transform the EU into a net-zero emissions economy and achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In this context, several decarbonization pathways have been proposed and a variety of renewable energy projects are being developed.","Rhoé started as a sustainable mobility research team founded on December 17 of the year 2016, by students from the civil engineering department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. In less than a year, it chose to take its innovative ideas to market. Within 5 years of establishment, Rhoé has received multiple awards and honors, not only regarding the innovativeness of its products and services, but also its insightfulness in its business strategy. 

 Some of Rhoé's most important achievements are: Two-time top 32 ICT startup in Greece by Greek Ministry of Digital Policy, Telecommunications and Media (2018 & 2019), one of the top 15 smart startups in the country in the field of smart cities by the Hellenic Institute of Transport (2019), participation in the National Fair of Thessaloniki (2018, 2019, 2021 & 2022), becoming members of the “green mind” project (2020), the National Register of Start-ups “Elevate Greece” (2021), the international shipping association “Interferry” (2021), the Hellenic Association of Mobile Applications Companies “ΣΕΚΕΕ-HAMAC” (2021), the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises “SEV” (2022), “Waterborne TP” (2022) and ERTICO-ITS Europe (2022), and winning 1st place in Greece at “Global Student Entrepreneurship Awards” (2022), as well as 1st place in two Urban Tech Challenges.

","Rhoé's team is consisted of engineers, data hounds, and visionaries, who are striving for a decarbonized future via the use of novel technologies. As a part of our comprehensive strategy, Rhoé is focused on collaborating on research and business ventures that match our areas of interest. We are committed to excellence in our work that leads to remarkable project results and products.

The green technologies and services sector is still maturing and doesn’t yet have all the answers to the environmental problems we face. This is where Rhoé has the upper hand over incumbents in the market. As we ramp up action on the climate and ecological crisis facing society, there are ever more opportunities to provide new products and services for the energy and transportation sector. Many of the solutions we need do not even exist yet, leaving an ‘innovation gap’ that needs to be plugged by people with bright ideas. Our vision is to bridge the gap between mobility, energy, and state-of-the-art technologies, creating a greener and a more sustainable future accessible to everyone.","One of Rhoé’s main fields of interest and activity is research. Rhoé is focused on collaborations on maritime and urban mobility R & D projects. In general, we are always open and looking for new projects and promising collaborations where we can co-create mutually beneficial synergies.","[{'title': 'EUREKA', 'amount': 'EUR 145', 'year': '2022', 'type': 'Pre Seed, Grant'}, {'title': 'Horizon Europe', 'amount': 'EUR 183K', 'year': '2021', 'type': 'Pre Seed, Grant'}, {'title': 'Horizon 2020', 'amount': 'EUR 324K', 'year': '2020', 'type': 'Pre Seed, Grant'}]",,"[{'title': 'Urban Tech Project', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2022', 'type': 'Funding'}, {'title': 'Entrepreuneurs Organization - GSEA', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2022', 'type': 'Services'}, {'title': 'Greek ministry of Development and Investments', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2021', 'type': 'Services'}, {'title': 'Interferry', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2021', 'type': 'Services'}, {'title': 'Enterprise Greece', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2019', 'type': 'Services'}, {'title': 'Hellenic Institute of Transport', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2019', 'type': 'Services'}, {'title': 'Greek Ministry of Digital Policy, Telecommunications and Media.', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2018', 'type': 'Services'}]","[{'title': 'Athens Startup Business Incubator', 'year': '2022', 'type': 'Program'}, {'title': 'OK!Thess', 'year': '2018', 'type': 'Program'}]",Bootstrapped,NA

To embrace challenges, escape their comfort zones, seek new connections and revel in the unknown.

At the Aphetor Games, we bring together some of Gen Z's heroes - the world's most kick-ass, fun and unique creators. They compete in extreme challenges, collaborate and create awesome content around the event.

Aphetor is all about...

1. Epic challenges, not traditional sports

Fun to do, entertaining to watch

2. Competitive creators, not performance athletes

Tough competition, but prioritising world-class content over world records

3. Content ecosystem, not content exclusivity

The more content, created by more people, distributed more broadly, the better

4. Fans as participants, not spectators

The audience determine outcomes, re-mix content and compete alongside the creators
","Our business model is innovative/disruptive in how we put all the pieces together (a ""full stack"" solution of owned IP and efficient event & content production & distribution) and leverage data to tap into different audiences, create a multiplier effect for our content ecosystem and cross-pollinate views from multiple creators and across channels. Unlike traditional sports whose commercial model depends on maintaining exclusivity and selling content IP rights to broadcasters or digital media, we encourage as much content creation around the Aphetor IP and open distribution of our content across channels.

As our content output, reach and engagement increase, our ability to monetize our audience through sponsorship and D2C models increases dramatically without significantly increasing our cost base. Like in a film, the production costs are the same regardless of the size of the audience. Our model is incredible scalable as we can grow the number of events per year (one every month), the number of participating creators, the avg number of followers per creator and the pieces of Aphetor content per creator. 
","Here’s a short flavor from our pilot https://vimeo.com/472965483/88fcefdc13 which was very successful. Recently, we were recognized among the 10 “Most Marketable  Properties of the Future…"" including properties such as Extreme E, Ligue 1, Fortnite World Cup and the WNBA.

Delivering our pilot event in September of last year in the midst of a pandemic was an incredible achievement (considering the Covid-19 restrictions in play and the fact that we had to change venue three weeks out) but has shown the flexibility and agility of our events and the experience and drive of our team to execute. More than that, however, we have managed to prove the key elements of the Aphetor model and de-risk our business, in particular: 

1. Our team can execute under the most difficult of circumstances. 

2. Aphetor delivers huge value to the influencers meaning that we can attract great content creators with huge audiences. 

3. The content model delivers an incredibly rich and deep content ecosystem that naturally works across all channels and formats. 

4. Our hybrid of sponsorship, influencer marketing and product placement creates a really compelling, unique and valuable proposition for brands. 
","We have a world class team in place with complimentary skills and experience as entrepreneurs, event and content producers, product builders and C-level managers at some of the largest sports, media, entertainment organizations (Man U, BBC, Discovery, YouTube, NIKE, Adidas, Sky, Gleam Futures, BT Sport and London Olympics) financial institutions and agencies (Engine) globally.

As such tasks cannot be performed under operating conditions, ship owners are forced to send their ships to dock inspection every two and a half to five years, causing high costs in labour and ship downtime. Robosurvey aspires to make a step towards offering the first fully autonomous UAV inspection system with its own scanning capabilities. The proposed solution relies on two small-size UAVs serving a dual role. The first vehicle (“scanner”) is launched into a narrow ship tank of unknown geometry, guided by advanced AI navigation algorithms, aiming to scan the space around it with LiDAR sensors. The scanned images are then processed by a local computing unit which is stored into a compact and portable control station, located on the ship. Based on the synthesised images and exploiting state-of-the art image processing.","The described solution that Robosurvey proposes will constitute the first ever fully automated ship tank inspection technology relying on UAVs, without the need of an expert pilot or crew to be present on the ship. This will allow Robosurvey Ltd. to offer an integrated inspection kit to container shipping companies, enhanced with surrounding services such as remote training or guidance during the inspection, as well as customisation of the offered solution according to the particularities of the space to be surveyed.","ROBOSURVEY aspires to make a step towards offering the first fully autonomous UAV inspection system with its own scanning capabilities.

The generated flight plan is not only capable of guiding the inspector, but thanks to Machine Learning algorithms trained with semi-empirical data, it also entails an optimised route focusing on the spots which are most likely to present vulnerabilities. The inspector is now capable of carrying out an independent survey of the space despite the lack of GPS connection.

Productivity and cost management get to another level by adopting the RTG solution combining artificial intelligence and innovative hardware. As retail e-commerce sales amounted to approximately $4,9 trillion worldwide in 2021, the Autonomous Mobile Robot market was valued at $2,1 billion with an upcoming growth rate of 24,6%. According to Statista 2022, the implementation of AMRs seems extremely attractive and profitable, yet warehouse managers seem to be quite conservative, and we know that the main reason is the investment in CAPEX they need to undertake along with the AMR purchase. This is why Robot-to-Go is here to become your partner-to-go, by launching new innovative features for the first time in the industry and inviting you in leading new market standards. ","We are offering an autonomous mobile robot covering your warehouse needs to the fullest. Robot-to-Go is designed to implement automation technology in warehouses-the software navigates the robots through the warehouse shelves, and the robots pick and transport the selected boxes from the shelves to the check-out area. Simple as that! With no human intervention needed, Robot-to-Go navigates within the warehouse and takes all the heavy-lifting, and even dangerous activities from the workers decreasing injuries and/or picking errors. The system is designed to improve the efficiency of e-commerce retailers who require rapid delivery by adapting to existing infrastructure, increasing storage capacity by 50% while also boosting throughput by 40%. This solution benefits e-commerce, 3PL, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, the retail industry, and many others. Orders can be fulfilled faster and better, supply chain bottlenecks can get streamlined, overhead costs go down and revenue up.  ","AMRs exist in the global market for almost 10-12 years and apply in several sectors, e.g., service robots, agricultural robots, disinfection robots, etc. AMRs started penetrating e-business warehouses in the last 2-3 years, mostly in the Asian market. We aspire to lead new profitable market standards and offer groundbreaking solutions so we are developing for the first time in the market a wireless charging AMR, that eliminates charging time and drives productivity to another level.  Due to its superior technical features and innovative hardware, there is no need for major investments in the warehouse (e.g., specialized shelves & floor other solutions required), while at the same time the number of boxes and heavy lift the robot can transfer establish it as a unique product to the AMR category. Finally, our proximity and immediacy in Europe (immediate service, competitive equipment installation, and maintenance costs) will enable us to offer a higher-caliber client experience.  
Competitors of Robot-to-Go are based in China and there are no other manufacturers in the European era. The targeting for our advanced robotic solution is not limited to the Greek market but aims to develop its sales mostly abroad, due to the bigger size of the market and higher demand for robotic solutions. However, the first steps will be carried out in the domestic market with the 1st phase, pilot-customer launching to be fulfilled in Q2/2023 and launching to the Greek market following. ","The development of a Greek company abroad is a particularly demanding and complex undertaking that requires an in-depth analysis of the target market. A milestone for the achievement of the project is the utilization of the already developed existing sales network of the company in Europe, as well as the strong cooperation ties with companies in the robotics sector (e.g., Universal Robots, Fanuc) that will help to penetrate the solution on the European continent. If the venture is crowned with success, the aim is to establish a branch of the company in a Central European country to strengthen its sales support and customer service, but also to develop multiple partnerships with companies active in the robotics industry in Europe. This is the 2nd phase, to be fulfilled in Q3/2025. As a 3rd phase, we consider the next stage, the orientation towards the North American mark. This market is more demanding due to its degree of maturity, while it requires the consideration of several factors that contribute to the success of the venture in the international market. 

We estimate that our prototype will be ready in March 2023 and we will implement the pilot operation within the next months. Hopefully, by the end of 2023 Robot-to-Go will be launched in the Greek market and we will be able to drive the Greek warehouse industry forward. ","Our team’s expertise, passion, and interest in innovative technologies are the catalysts of our project’s development. Our approach is inclusive and at the same time multifaceted due to the different multidisciplinary professional experiences each of our team members has. Mr. Nikos Morenos is the founder and the man behind Robot-to-Go’s vision, he is known as a sales ninja and has counted many years of experience in the manufacture of packaging machinery and robotic systems (pick & place, palletizing systems, and complete production lines).  Mr. Petros Koronidis, our tech wizard, had undertaken the engineering design and product development of RTG. His in-depth knowledge of product design and development has been forged from his many years of professional experience in leading manufacturing companies.

It designs and manufactures the first FDA-cleared, patient-specific, anatomically-exact models of human head and brain tissue. These are offered to Radiotherapy clinics for simulating radiation therapy for each patient ahead of actual treatment in a totally risk-free environment, thus maximizing cancer patient safety and treatment effectiveness.
This solution is also sold to RT equipment manufacturers for machine-testing purposes. The company already generates revenues and has signed a commercial agreement with a leading radiation therapy company, Elekta A.B. As a winner of an R&D 100 Award, RTsafe’s PseudoPatient® is recognized as one of the 100 most significant high-tech products worldwide for 2019.
Vision: Helping to create a world where every radiotherapy intervention is tested on a personalized phantom before the real patient, thus enhancing safety and effectiveness of treatment.","RTsafe has developed, patented, and commercialized a world-first technology that allows the production of an accurate model of the human head and brain (phantom) for each patient. The final product perfectly mimics the individual head and brain tissue in terms of external and internal anatomy and bone and soft tissue interaction with radiation. This enables the RT team to irradiate an exact replica of the patient in advance of the actual treatment, establishing radiological and geometrical accuracy of the delivery and identifying any errors in advance. This provides greater confidence in the individual treatment, but also the ability to improve the overall treatment protocols. 
Our technology harnesses the latest developments in CT-scanning, 3D-printing, and gel radiation dosimetry (the science of determining appropriate radiation doses). The result is the first ever patient-specific QA process in RT for truly personalized brain tumor treatments. We call our unique product PseudoPatient®. It is perfectly suited to high-dose, high-accuracy brain treatment techniques, such as Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), increasingly being used to treat brain metastases.
","The core of the solution lies in the combination of three recent technological advances: (i) medical imaging technology (CT and MRI), (ii) the emerging 3D printing technology and (iii) point, 2D and, most importantly, 3D radiation dose detection using polymer gels. The key idea is to produce a patient’s anatomical replica (PseudoPatient®), install radiation detectors, treat PseudoPatient® as if it was the real patient, verify dose delivery or highlight errors detected, allow for corrections, and then treat the actual patient. This approach constitutes a simulation of patient’s treatment, and verifies not only the dose distribution calculated by the treatment-planning system, but also serves as an end-to-end test for the entire treatment protocol implemented. Through this method, the following steps of the treatment chain are reproduced: (a) patient imaging, (b) patient immobilization (e.g., stereotactic frame or thermoplastic mask), (c) image guidance and patient positioning, and (d) radiation dose delivery.
Manufacturing hardware consists of easy-to-install 3D printers and standard laboratory equipment, the cost of which is not significant. Thus, scalability is achievable via the multiplication of production sites in sites that will support demand accordingly.
","RTsafe has achieved significant commercial traction, and its products and services are already being sold across all our target customer segments (2019 revenue: €0.5M). Noteworthy examples are: 
•tCommercial distribution agreement for Machine QA with Elekta A.B. – Secured revenues for 3 years to end of 2022
•tExclusivity agreements with independent distributors:
    otReached in Italy, Spain, Turkey, Cyprus, SE Asia.

For a detailed list of our end users, please visit our website at https://rt-safe.com/clients/","Our team consists of 21 members combining profund business acumen and high technological know-how based in strong scientific background. This team is capable of executing RTsafe's robust business plan.
The global Personalized PseudoPatient® market is worth €6.0b (2018: 4M brain-lesions patients x €1.5K, cost of a PseudoPatient®). In particular, SRS treatments (which RTsafe services are essential for), will grow by 150% in next 10 years making this a great opportunity. RTsafe projects annual revenues of > €60M with gross margin of > 70% by 2025. This is an entirely new market sector with no direct competitors.
Initial growth is projected from commercial expansion in developed markets that have high SRS utilization, particularly the USA and EU5. We will leverage our existing commercial footprint and distributor network to expand further into the top Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCCs) and Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) in the USA and the EU5, with the aim of acquiring a 10% share in both regions through recurrent paying customers by Yr3 post-financing. These early notoriously adopters are closely monitored by other countries before accepting new technologies into their healthcare systems. Once established in the USA and EU5, we will continue expanding into new territories, and aim to have made significant commercial in-roads in such regions as the UAE, Japan and China by end of Yr3 post financing.","RTsafe is raising €3 million of growth capital in its second funding round, to drive commercial growth in targeted works and further expand its product portfolio. This financing is projected to propel the Company to €63 million in revenues and €24 million in EBITDA within five years, and fully fund the Company to a strategic exit.  Management seeks to partner with investors who will bring value beyond capital.
The company aims to meet very specific commercial and technical milestones in the timeframe that is relevant to the investment sought to be used as metrics for the company’s progress.","[{'title': 'Venture Friends & Rising Stars I Coooperatief UA', 'amount': 'EUR 850K', 'year': '2019', 'type': 'Seed, Loan / Investment Bank'}, {'title': 'Rising Stars I Coooperatief UA', 'amount': 'EUR 1.88M', 'year': '2017', 'type': 'Seed, Angel'}, {'title': 'Rising Stars I Coooperatief UA', 'amount': 'EUR 390K', 'year': '2014', 'type': 'Pre Seed, Angel'}, {'title': 'Hellenic Entrepreneurship Award - Hellenic Initiative', 'amount': 'EUR 210K', 'year': '2014', 'type': 'Pre Seed, Loan / Investment Bank'}]","[{'title': 'RTsafe', 'type': 'International Patent', 'status': 'Awarded'}, {'title': 'RTsafe', 'type': 'European Patent Office', 'status': 'Awarded'}, {'title': 'RTsafe', 'type': 'US Patent & Trademark Office', 'status': 'Awarded'}]","[{'title': 'R&D 100 Award - R&D Magazine - USA', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2019', 'type': 'Services'}, {'title': 'Seal of Excellence Horizon2020 - European Commission', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2019', 'type': 'Services'}, {'title': 'MIT Enterprise Forum Greece', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2015', 'type': 'Services'}, {'title': 'Hellenic Entrepreneurship Award', 'awarded_for': None, 'year': '2014', 'type': 'Funding'}]","[{'title': 'EIT Health Catapult', 'year': '2020', 'type': 'Program'}, {'title': 'Startup3', 'year': '2020', 'type': 'Program'}, {'title': 'MIT Enterprise Forum', 'year': '2015', 'type': 'Program'}]",Series A,NA

Overall, physical inactivity was associated with numerous diseases such as 42% higher risk of diabetes, 24% higher risk of coronary heart disease and 16% increased, increased stress levels, risk of stroke, obesity and lower quality of life in general.

Additionally, a significant part of intra-city mobility could be done on foot, or by bicycle and a combination of means of public transportation. Nevertheless, habits, inertia and lack of motivation lead many citizens to use a private vehicle, even though, in many cases this is actually more costly and slower, while the overall result is increased traffic and pollution. 
","Run4more is a mobile application, in which users can track and record their physical activity and be rewarded with points for it. These points can be redeemed in partner companies by winning gift cards, discounts and special offers

We give our users proper effective incentives, in order to take the first step towards a shift in their everyday routine that could significantly improve their health and living conditions. 

More importantly, R4M is not another fitness, or running App. It is an incentives’ mechanism that aims to impact the majority of the population. Our goal is to create, a playful and engaging app to manage and maintain effective internal and external, financial, and non-financial incentives towards a physically active way of life, on a daily basis, for everyone.
","We create a reward program for fitness behavior that targets all mobile users. In contrast to fitness Apps, R4M focuses on providing incentives for everyone. We provide to our customers a large audience to promote their products, services, or exclusive offers. The App is designed so that ads are always present at dedicated tabs, offering scalable mobile advertising.

By creating a community of people around the philosophy “move to earn”, we capture a potentially very large audience that all brands are looking to engage with, but it is costly to do so at scale via traditional advertising means.

Additionally, we are developing machine learning algorithms to suggest the most suitable offers for our users’ profiles, while at the same time adjusting our offers value and difficulty, to help them increase and maintain their physical activity.

By gathering a large amount of data from the activity of our users, we will be able to identify the type of ads that perform better per industry, as well as various clusters of target groups for our customers.

By aggregating and analyzing data from activity trackers and the existing running apps we offer a whole new layer of value to brands and help them understand user behavior. We become a marketing tool for brands to understand how they could market and create new products for their target audience.

Floating marine plastics are a threatening problem for the world’s oceans. Marine plastic debris is tied to plastic production, which has grown exponentially over the last 70 years, from 1.7 million tonnes in 1950 to 322 million tonnes in 2015. It is estimated that between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tonnes of plastic entered the ocean from terrestrial sources in 2010 alone, with rivers contributing to 1.15 and 2.41 million tonnes of plastic waste. Remote sensing is one of the tools necessary for the detection of floating marine plastics because of the extensive area coverage and frequent observation. While floating plastics are reported in high concentrations in many places around the globe, no referencing dataset exists either for understanding the spectral behavior of plastics in the real environment or for calibrating remote sensing algorithms and validating their results.","Our solution is the creation of a UAS platform technology for systematically mapping natural phenomena like marine litter density, coastal erosion, oil spill detection, and other custom UAV data maps. In terms of marine litter debris, our solution is the detection and monitoring of marine litter (ML) on coastal zones by creating ML density maps from data taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and analyzed with the use of our sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. Our system is semi-autonomous, and we can create different types of density maps based on customers’ needs.","Our main business idea is the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems equipped with true-color RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral sensors for close remote sensing to map emerge phenomena (like marine litter) in the coastal environment.

However, the information that all drivers miss and the question that cannot be answered with the existing apps is the following: “What about the parking options at my destination (free or paid)? Will it be easy or difficult to find a parking spot?”. This is exactly the question that ScienTra is answering through its main product “ParKey” app. It helps the user to tackle with the ever-increasing parking problem encountered in almost all modern urban areas. Providing a solution to this common problem can decrease traffic, upgrade urban mobility, improve road safety, reduce the environmental footprint and contribute to a better quality of life for all citizens. The benefits to the user/driver are equally important since ParKey can save them valuable time, money, as it makes parking as an easy task as possible.","Our key product is to provide drivers with a mobile application through which they can easily scan and have a clear picture of the parking demand and also their parking options in their destination area. The App will inform the user, depending on the time and day of the year of the destination, how probable is to find a free empty on-street or off-street parking space (conventional vehicle, disabled vehicle, electric vehicle, motorcycles, bicycles). More specifically, the app will cluster and visualize with different colors all roads near the destination according to the probability of finding a free on-street parking space or a free parking space in a public lot or garage. Moreover, it will give the opportunity to the user to be informed about the controlled parking zones and the private parking lots or garages along with the respective costs. The dynamic ParKey map will be updated depending on the time, the day as well as all important changes due to holidays, big events etc.","ScienTra (Science of Transport) is transforming science into practice incorporating the high scientific level in various fields of Transportation. Competitors, worldwide, provide information for private parking lots and garages and parking demand information through sensors. Nevertheless this information is limited to small areas as it is impossible to have sensors at all parking spaces in a larger area. On the contrary, Parkey is undertaking several, big-scale, detailed counts of on-street and off-street supply and demand and parking turnover for typical and non-typical days for 24 hours during several periods over the year, and through appropriate modeling techniques will develop the dynamic parking demand map with accurate information for each vehicle category. Parkey will be the first app that will enable the user to have a clear visualization of the parking demand in large area around their destination, which will be a criterion for optimizing the driving route and decide about their probable parking spot prior to reaching the destination. This will take place through AI techniques (traffic demand, driving behaviour) and GIS oriented optimization solutions using appropriate modelling techniques. With ParKey, traffic delays are minimized, road accidents are reduced as there is no confusion for the driver where to park, and environmental impact is also positive due to minimized routes. No sensors are needed, no installation / hardware / maintenance is required.","Our journey so far (major milestones):

The problem that SE&C IKE solves emerged out of the combination of 2 market challenges. 
1) Efficient building materials. According to a study that was carried out by the 28 Member States of the European Union, it was concluded that the high rate of energy consumption over the past twenty years (250-300 Mtoe) is attributed to building requirements for heating, cooling and ventilation due to their unsatisfactory thermal insulation. 
2) Stricter regulatory fire safety conditions. Even though the construction works are ongoing, only in the recent years the safety of such infrastructures has gained increasing attention, particularly the issue of fire. This transformation in the mentality is attributed to a series of large fires that have taken place in the last years such as in the Mandarin hotel in UK and in the eastern Attica in Greece (Mati) which led to human casualties, major structural damages

Yet, the average person lacks knowledge and/or understanding of what the maritime industry contributes to society. More so, the younger generation lacks knowledge of this vast contribution but also how largely this translates into a wide spectrum of career opportunities. Last, there is a large gap in maritime innovation as related to the maritime industry’s sustainability and its huge part in the world’s sustainability. So, the game attempts to fill this gap, namely to
•create an ecosystem around the sea and the marine environment
•highlight business & career opportunities of the marine & maritime sector
•inform about the contribution of shipping to society
•enlighten about its contribution in the world sustainability 
•cultivate new relevant skills to the young generation 

","-Our solution is a resource Management Strategy Game, for acquiring, monitoring, and leveraging maritime resources, like ships, ports, fisheries, inland waterways etc.  The game is linked videos which users will be able to access through scanning a QR code. In this interactive way, they can access added/pop-up material i.e., educational videos, real sounds collected from the different parts of the ship, a photographic library with information about the milestones of Greek and international maritime history. The whole environment will be immersive and sense-engaging and seeks to encourage learning through an emotional, creative, and entertaining way. The game will highlight the importance of the maritime industry and promote the European & International Green Deal initiatives. There shall be a focus in the area of digital earth by making the current technological advances available to users, not only for play, but also for tangible vocation skills and career paths.
","-The most innovative aspect of our game is the custom-built economy engine.  As the game progresses, the economies change, making each decision having a stronger impact, considering cargos, weather, regulations, new technologies, obstacles, the financial scene.
The Economy AI Engine is responsible for creating an “index market simulation” and KPIs which the players shall use to make strategic decisions. What it does, to begin with, is that it takes random prices for the three distinguished categories of the economy (based on the three different types of ships -bulkers, tankers, containers) and then it builds from there. It takes into consideration decisions that the player has taken and adjusts considering these decisions. The situation of the “index market simulation” is also one of the mechanics that creates the available contracts for the player. Also, it has prebuilt fluctuations set for specific in-game periods meaning that every session of the game is different. 
The game is scalable and replicable globally, to relevant to the maritime industry or in other industries, replicating the edutainment concept to serve the needs of other industries. Furthermore, our goal for the near future is to invest in new games for other maritime sectors such as cruises or vessels as well as to approach new target groups within naval academies and companies for educational & bonding purposes. we  inspire to expand this concept to an edutainment theme park (physical presence) for age 4-16

","SEEMS has developed aRTi-DTM, an integrated Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solution (HW & SW) supported by Artificial Intelligence and Edge computing technologies to monitor, control, predict and optimize productions’ performance in real-time. In more detail, aRTi-DTM collects real-time data from the production site, converts it into useful information, which results into trends, predictions, and recommendations. At the same time, with the use of AI, the root-cause of known and unknown problems is identified. At a final level, aRTi-DTM AI algorithms combine and analyse the already processed information more in depth to provide suggestions for improvement in real-time. In this way decisions are based on real-time qualitative data of the entire production and not on siloed data per machine.","The key benefit that differentiates aRTi-D TM is that it is a single and simple solution that enables manufacturers to use real-time AI recommendations to optimize their production performance with low investment, support and scalability cost. Unlike current solutions, aRTi-DTM can deliver any IIoT application due to its modular architecture, developed 100% in house, along with its ability to connect to existing systems that guarantees simplicity in use, flexibility in support and ease to expand. 
With real-time AI recommendations for improvement, aRTi-DTM can lead to reduced waste, machine downtime, energy consumption per product and consequently operating costs increasing thus productivity. In other words, with aRTi-DTM a manufacturing unit can produce more products with less costs.
","aRTi-DTM clients come from the pharmaceutical, food and beverages, chemicals, pulp & paper, power generation and solar water heating industry.

The formulation in the absence of alcohol is an excellent source of nutritional requirements for microorganisms to grow. Other parameters, like alkalinity pH >3,5, and non controlled storage temperature, increase the risks of microbial growth in the products. .As a result almost all of the non-alc products use preservative to ensure the stability , safety and shelf life of the product, before first opening, while contribute to the prevention of microbial growth once the bottle is opened.

Brand Owners
Alligned with the ever-growing trend towards health awareness and wellbeing , 

-“No Preservatives” is the top “clean label” claim, and preservatives is the the most unwanted food additive.Their absence gives competitive advantage over competition and “natural” claim amplifies key message and gives value to the product. 

-“Clean label” will become more important for non alcoholic spirits, along with transition and establishment of distribution  from on- to off-trade mainstream channels.

-Polishes the health and wellness key message, (e.g no alcohol which is healthy , but preservatives, which never existed in alcoholic spirits)

Bottlers : 
Sodium benzoate “E211” most commonly used in non alcoholic beverages, and other preservatives, will soon be not regulatory compliant with authorities.

Value Chain : 
Durability & Shelf life
Expiration once opened
Not refillable.

Consumers : 
Proper handling by consumer (refrigerators, short shelf life once opened) is usually neglected, but with sterile pourer these can be surpassed
No allergens
Better taste, as preservatives alter taste.
Food safety
Can be verified through the mobile apps that scan label, and inform about side effects and “bad additives”

A single shopping passport for the digital & physical world.","Simpler makes everything shoppable with 1 click. We help merchants boost sales by making it extremely easy for shoppers to checkout in seconds from anywhere - both in the digital world (e-commerce stores, shoppable ads/content) and the physical world (brick & mortar, print ads, TV etc). ","We offer an experience that covers the whole spectrum of what we call ""checkout"". This starts with user details and extends to shipping methods and payment methods. With our ""Checkout from anywhere"", the shopper can checkout in seconds, without having to visit the merchant's website or app: simply by clicking on an online advertisement, an email/newsletter, in a chat, a print ad, in a magazine, a product catalog or even from a TV ad.

In other words, we are making everything easily ""shoppable"", taking the customer directly to the last step of the funnel and eliminating all redirections and steps in between (which directly increases conversions for the merchants).

","From an innovation standpoint, the future from a business and tech perspective, is largely driven by 4 major customer imperatives: how the products/ services can be cheaper, faster, easier, and safer.

In our domain, we are standing in the intersection of ecommerce & fintech, redefining the checkout experience and rethinking the customer's journey starting from the intent to buy, all the way to the last step of the funnel, that of the checkout, aiming to change completely how people shop, giving them a faster, easier and safer way to buy anything from anywhere.

In terms of scalability, we have built a fully scalable product, ready to serve merchants & shoppers in Europe, US & Middle East with minimal adjustments.
","In just 10 months after launch, we work with over 65 merchants in Greece, UK & Spain. We have signed large retailers (from 30M to 80M GMV) and we are working closely with Fortune500 companies to deploy this solution in the coming months.

","The founding team consists of Rania Lamprou, Alex Kyriakopoulos and Spyros Mandekis. 
Rania (CEO) has a background in finance, but she has always been involved with startups, leading positions in sales and product, managing teams in 6 countries.
Alex has a technical background, having worked at Investment Banking in Zurich for years, first at Credit Suisse as a director and then as the leader of the technical team that built Vontobel's new asset management platform.
Spyros founded his own company NestCargo and then had engineering lead positions at Glispa, Market Group and Plum Fintech.

7 out of the 15 people worked together in building a retargeting real-time-bidding DSP for ecommerce clients - they were dealing with high-throughput, low-latency systems handling 4 billion ads per month. They have deep industry knowledge of the shopping funnels, CR, and complex data-pipeline infrastructure systems.

We built an experienced team with deep domain expertise, operating in a green-field market (Europe) at the right time - a company that already proved that it can be very capital-efficient, signing deals with merchants who will 10X our GMV in the coming months. Our vision is to make Simpler the default way of shopping, anywhere.

","Aquatic Biologicals develops and manufactures autogenous vaccines and phage therapy products for farmed fish, aiming at effective disease management without the use of antibiotics. Autogenous vaccines are vaccines that do not require a marketing authorisation as they are manufactured on the basis of the pathogen that caused the disease in a fish farm and are used exclusively in that farm. Phage therapy is based on the use of viruses that infect bacteria as an alternative treatment to antibiotics. These viruses, called bacteriophages, are the natural enemies of bacteria and can target only the pathogenic bacteria without affecting the beneficial bacteria in the fish gut or the environment. These products are tailor-made for each facility and are offered together with advisory and advanced diagnostic services.  ","The potential for scaling is great as the Mediterranean aquaculture industry, which is Aquatic Biologicals' core market, is growing rapidly and diversifying with the introduction of new fish species. There is a large gap in specialised fish disease prevention products as the large pharmaceutical companies have salmon farming as their core market rather than sea bream, sea bass and other Mediterranean species.

It is the consumers’ last touchpoint with the brand and significantly affects the consumer experience and loyalty. For customers, shipping can be the deciding factor between two retailers, and for retailers, it can be the difference between success and failure.

In Greece, parcel delivery has fallen short of customer expectations, mainly due to lack of investments in infrastructure and technology. Most e-tailers are single carrier and offer no options for their shipping. Cash-on-delivery is 50% of total revenue, and 1 out of 4 items shipped will be returned, with very poor technology in place to seamlessly and efficiently manage these challenges. 
Meanwhile, e-commerce is becoming multichannel using multiple fulfillment methods (incl. physical stores, drop-shipping, 3PL-4PL) and consumers are becoming more demanding in the shipping ","Shiplemon is a shipping management software designed to help e-commerce managers improve their consumer experience, through shipping & delivering. 

Our system is connected with all major couriers in Greece and with all major e-commerce platforms so that e-shop managers, can easily find the best way to ship a package and create instant labels and shipping documentation. Every shipment is different, and shipping is not a one-size-fits all service. Emphasis might be on speed, cost, or convenience and this leads to very different decisions in shipping a package. In addition, consumers want to have a say in the way their package will be shipped. 

What we do differently is creating a centralized system for all shipping & delivering options. All couriers & last mile providers in a single location, so our users can compare prices, delivery times, reliability and chose the best way to send their package. Our users can choose to make use of their contracted rates or use our negotiated rates. As an aggregator we are in a position to negotiate deep discounts, and offer prices offered only to large e-tailers.

Along with consolidating the market in a single system, we offer functionalities not previously available to users of these companies. To name a few examples: Checkout module, Notifications, Returns, Analytics and many more.

Shiplemon turns shipping into a competitive advantage.
","Our service can have a new e-shop up and running, with a complete shipping platform, with access to wholesale shipping rates, ready to send a package anywhere in the world, in just a few clicks.
Shiplemon is the first aggregator & consolidator of last mile services in Greece. Our users can see every possible way to ship a package, compare prices and delivery times and make smart shipping decisions. Our shipping rules bring automation & efficiency. Our negotiated wholesale rates democratize the shipping rates of large etailers to everyone - regardless of the chosen shipping method.

Our model is very scalable. E-commerce shipping needs are universal.
The major courier companies are global. 
E-commerce platforms are also global.
Localization is necessary. We connect all the local players (couriers, ERPs, 4PLs), before we enter our next market. Greece will operate as a springboard for the Balkans & East Med.
e-commerce is growing everywhere 


","Shiplemon launched in September 2021 and currently has 485 registered users, 104 connected e-shops and has managed 10,000+ orders.
Our revenue for the first 10 months was 130,000 eur. 

Our business model is hybrid, monthly subscription, along with transactional charges. 
If a label is issued using our wholesale rates, we markup the price
We also charge per sms, per return, and if someone wants to use our API.

Argo Semi’s vision is to deliver RF and antenna technologies that will make the modern cellular radios more accessible to large and needy populations, such as in India and Africa.
Argo Semi has developed unique solutions that allow substantial cost savings for 5G Radio Units and it has established relations with tier-1 semiconductor providers and operators. 
Presently, it is looking for Series A financing, primarily for covering silicon tape-out costs and the company growth. 
","ArgoSemi has developed silicon and antenna technologies that allow the decoupling of the number of data processing chains in a sub-6GHz radio from the number of the antenna elements attached to these chains. Consequently, a smaller number of data processing chains can be traded for antenna arrays with a larger number of antenna elements. Part of this solution is a true 2-dimensional antenna panel for the 3.5GHz band that relies on low cost Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing, as opposed to 3D structures requiring expensive customized manufacturing used by the competition. The value to the end-user is the flexibility to control the trade-off of coverage-vs-capacity in the deployment, allowing substantial cost savings.","The solution offered by ArgoSemi is enabled by multiple innovative elements, such as embedded active splitter/combiners, innovative antennas for massive MIMO, as well as the small cell, distributed beamforming techniques and digital intensive RF architectures. ArgoSemi is possessing an expanding patent portfolio, presently including one granted patent and five pending ones. Our patent portfolio creates a barrier-to-entry for the competition and allows our company to pursue its objective, that is, to trade unneeded performance to achieve a substantial cost reduction. Our unique proposition has already attracted the attention of large potential customers, primarily in the APAC geographical area. ","Argo Semi collaborates with tier-1 semiconductor companies that wish to exploit the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) and penetrate the cellular market. 
Argo Semi has in-house developed sub-6GHz silicon RF technology that can be used for RFIC complements of these tier-1 semiconductor companies. Furthermore, Argo Semi has launched its second generation of the pioneering printed circuit antenna array product. The above have been achieved while the company operates in a self-financed mode. 
","Argo Semi has been founded by a team of industry professionals with long experience in the semiconductor industry and the antenna industry, both at the engineering/product development domain and the business development. The core team is formed by old colleagues from Broadcom, one of the largest semiconductors companies in the world with specialty on communications circuits, they have developed products that collectively have been sold in billions of units and they hold tenths of patents.

Energy demand is on the rise, because of the rise in global population, as well as the rapid urbanization in the developing countries. Besides that, energy must and already is, shifting towards renewable energy sources, due to the climate change, already observed all over the world. According to Bloomberg we need to add 1.37 GW daily in renewable energy from now to 2050 in order to achieve the zero-carbon goal.

Greatest beneficiary from that shift will be utility scale solar power projects. Due to the increased competition in that field most of these utility scale solar power projects will be developed in arid areas near the equator. In these areas, we have the problem of soiling, which significantly reduces power production (up to 1% daily if not cleaned) and limited availability in water to perform the cleaning.

In this double problem SOLBOTIX comes to the rescue with it’s robotic waterless cleaning systems, which allow for automatic every day cleaning, enabling 100% power production in every environment.
","In high soil areas, the dusty environment causes extreme soiling and cementation which can reduce power output by up to 10% or more within 10-15 days if they are not cleaned regularly (every 1-2 days). For a typical 100 MWp parc producing >200 GWh annually, the potential revenue loss could be >$500k mil or more annually, $10 mil or more over the entire useful life of the project.
Traditional cleaning methods (labor or mechanically assisted) will not be applicable, as cleaning frequency will have to move from 3-4 times per year to 2-3 times per week or ideally on a daily basis, so the market will be forced to move to autonomous cleaning devices.
Using autonomous cleaning robots in remote soil reach - water poor areas, Solar Power owner/operators can gain higher revenues, improved ROI and reduced operating costs and operating risks
•tHigher income from power production, closer to 100% of peak capacity – up to $500k or more annual incremental revenue for a typical 100 MWp utility scale parc 
•tReduced capital and operating costs: no water infrastructure (as this is a water free operation), limited or no labor cost.
•tReduced operating risks: no water, no large numbers of unskilled labor, no vegetation, no damages from corrosion or moist, no damages to anti-reflective coating from brooms or other misuse.
","Solbotix www.solbotix.com  is a new innovative way to keep your Solar PV panels free from dust, while eliminating the dependencies on water and unskilled labor. Particularly useful in high soil areas like Middle East, Africa, China, India, SE Asia, South America, where high levels of dust can cause significant power loss, up to 10% or more in few days if not cleaned regularly. 
Up to now pv panel cleaning in arid areas is done by manual cleaning and using water. This model is not viable because of scarcity of both laborers and water in arid areas, resulting in infrequent cleaning and reduced power generation of the pv plants. Moreover water used usually comes from desalination plants using diesel as fuel, polluting this way the environment.",Starting from just an idea (March 202021) and a clean sheet of paper 3 months later we have achieved to have an MVP one and a half years later. Field test are beginning November 2022.

This technology could potentially open the market for chip manufacturers and enable sensitive, high-performance computing, in those harsh environments.","We are developing hardware that deflects ionised radiation away from mission systems to protect all kinds of electronics from radiation. Using this shielding device, the ionisation dosage experienced is reduced and allows the use of commercial off-the-shelf electronics and sensors in space; something that could unlock the vast potential of modern electronics for manufacturing in space, real-time processing, recycling the GEO graveyard, space exploration and more.","The space radiation environment is limiting the capabilities of satellites in space. It remains one of the biggest threats for manned missions to this day. Technologies that have been developed are mitigating the effects of radiation on the electronics (eg. triple redundancies), but still, the industry is looking for a commercial shielding solution that would enable all the high-end processing units, memories and cameras to operate in such a harsh environment. Improving the radiation environment that the satellite electronics are exposed to, would act as a catalyst for future space missions.

Our aim is to enable off-the-shelf electronics in space, over and beyond the radiation belts, something that has not been possible before.","We have filed two patents, built two working prototypes and tested them in a plasma beam facility. We have raised private investment since 2018, have received a contract with DSTL and grants from UKRI, ESA and the UK space agency. We have also received letters of support from space companies for developing our technology further.","We have a stellar team of engineers and scientists for delivering our innovative shielding solution to the market.

We continually enrich our base through partnerships with people who are willing to lend their space for a few hours or a few days as a way to secure an extra income, without even having to leave their homes.

Your house is a filming location: There is no limit to the type of property you can list on platform. All types of spaces are welcome on Spaceprk because there is an unseen demand for nearly everything in creative industries. Examples include warehouses in the USA, village houses in Italy, estates in Greece, cottages in the UK – even historical ruins, parking lots, boats, and cars have been rented through Spaceprk. Regardless of your city or listing type, there is someone who is looking to use a space like yours to use for their next film, show, or advertisement.
 
With absolute security and a guarantee for the careful use of your space, we offer you the opportunity to use it and increase your monthly income.","Spaceprk is an online marketplace for non-hospitality rentals, filling the gap that Airbnb left open. Through Spaceprk, owners can offer part or all of the space for rent. Owners can list villas, flats, gardens, terraces, bars, stores, factories, warehouses, garage, basements, even semi-detached houses & fields with short-term lease (by time or day) for ""special uses"" such as filming, video clips, advertising, fashion show, photography, seminars, parties, business conferences, securing an additional income, while the users of the platform find the space that exactly fits in their need. This peer-to-peer platform offers benefits to owners and renters, while making it more convenient for them to connect and negotiate.
•Owners get extra income, without disturbing their daily life (without having to leave their home in most cases), as they choose when, how, at whom & at what price they have their space.
•Renters get many alternative, one-of-a-kind spaces and solutions that they could not find & access otherwise, in a minimum of time and cost. Spaceprk-listed properties have already hosted the filming of scenes from international TV series, movies, commercials, as well as several music video clips, which have been successful in Greece and abroad.

Aside from filming, large companies and ordinary individuals have organized their events and celebrations (including online events) through Spaceprk. Spaceprk also offers location services to directors, producers, and advertisers.","We conduct daily research into market conditions and competition worldwide. There is an undeniable need by individuals for additional income as the sharing economy is gaining a stronger position in the market for goods and services. The daily communication we have with our network of owners and renters is vital to our positioning - we study their needs and the needs of each region. In Greece and most foreign countries there is no corresponding online platform, renting (by the hour or the day) for ""special uses"" such as films, video clips, advertisements, demonstrative fashion, photography, parties, and conferences. In countries where a similar platform exists, the charge for services is bared by both owners and renters, and fees can be reduced for all parties with commission limits.  Finally, our location services & online events will further strengthen our competitive advantage.

-Abundance of choice for renters, from renting a traditional studio to a one-of-a-kind castle
-Immediate gratification for renters, knowing what is available during specific time periods
-Ease of finding spaces and features that fit the specific details of your vision, search by characteristics like color scheme, accessibility, and architectural style
-Comfort of completing a search and posting a listing remotely – rather than going into an event-planning agency & spending hours figuring out what needs to be done
-Flexibility for owners to make their space available based on their own schedule","During our 2 first years of operation, Spaceprk has played a very important role as a host for production companies as we have given have access to a number of alternative spaces functioning as studios which the companies could not otherwise gain access to given their timelines and budgets. More than 650 film productions (Greece and abroad) have been shot on Spaceprk properties. Additionally, multinational companies and ordinary individuals have organized over 100 events (both physical and online) with Spaceprk.

","Innovation:
There are few software products in the global market that can be used as a complete business management suite (for SMEs), and address the problem of fragmentation in business operations. Especially in the Greek market, there is no such solution in place.  

Coordi aims to address exactly this need, and there lies its innovation. The companies using Coordi avoid the implementation of separate solutions (with different learning curves) for covering their business needs, and also avoid the difficult and costly task of interconnecting these solutions to achieve operational excellence. Instead, with Coordi they get an out of the box solution that covers all the basic needs of a modern business, with a single login and the same user experience everywhere - and everything seamlessly interconnected. 

Scalability:
The solution is offered both as a SaaS and with a licensing model - depending on the implementation. Localisation in different languages is pretty simple, providing the means for global expansion (Greek and English already implemented). As such, Coordi is fully scalable both in Greece and in foreign markets.
","Coordi is commercially available since 2020, reaching a good maturity level in 2022 and counting approximately 70 installations (end 2022). 

All key product modules are commercially proven and stable, focus being now on enhancing key vertical propositions (eCommerce businesses / distributors / construction businesses) and SaaS model.
","We are a team of 9 professionals in the fields of computer engineering, UI/UX. sales, finance, and marketing. Our focus is to expand our team and enhance all vital functions within our team: Product, Sales, Marketing, Customer Experience, and Finance. 

We believe our product - Coordi - is unique in its offering, being a high quality turn key solution for our target market segments.
 
Greece is our focus market at this stage, and we strive to enhance our team to cover the needs of this market as we will be growing our footprint. We focus on B2B commercial companies (distributors, wholesalers), companies in the construction sector, and e-commerce companies.

We are now making our first steps implementing our solution abroad, Cyprus being our first market to have presence.
","Currently we are self funded and try to be profitable enough to expand our team and business. 

We expect to need further funding to boost sales and marketing, and also to enhance our team with new members, as we will try to intensify our sales efforts within 2023.

In the next decade a boom is expected in the domain of Renewables and in particular PV plants. In parallel many IoT based and AI, ICT technologies and solutions are made available. We have seen currently a gap and need for the focused use of these technologies to bring supervision, production prediction and preventive maintenance of these plants to a new level that will be required in the new conditions of the liberal Energy market. The new model of these markets with high percentage of RES will require a new set of production prediction technologies to assure grid stability and reliability, especially for the day-ahead operation. We are aiming to a PV plant portfolio adapted IoT solution allowing data collection at representative string level in order to allow both preventive maintenance incl. error detection and building of accurate physical particular PV plants models that in combination of microclimate predictions and ML methods will allow also optimal day-ahead predictions.
 ","The envisaged solution to be offered to clients for the management of their PV plant portfolio and the prediction of its day-ahead production for energy market use, is based on the integration of 
- a PV adapted IoT solution allowing data collection at string level of chosen strings (based on self created string selection methodology). This low cost monitoring will allow in combination with existing data from inverters and local weather stations to build an physical model of the plant adaptable to real conditions. The physical model can be used both for production predictions (especially in clear sky conditions) and for preventive maintenance of the parks.
- ML techniques (ANNs, Fuzzy Neural models and LSTM) to correct the prediction errors expected by numerical weather predictions and the physical model based on statistical historical data based methods. This will allow accurate day-ahead predictions also when the physical model cannot usually provide it (i.e. cloudy days)","- Our Innovation relies on the tested smart use of sample string level data collection that will allow with low cost to build an accurate physical model of the PV plant portfolio of clients that in combination with available data from inverters, numerical weather predictions at local level, and adapted Machine learning methods like ANNs, Fuzzy-Neural Networks, Long-short term memory (LSTM) that will be used for the correction of usual errors of the physical models, will allow very accurate day-ahead predictions at  competitive cost. 
the solution is scalable to portfolios 
In case the product will be ready to market on time (est. one year) it will come at the right time for the many PV plants that started to be constructed from 2019-2020 but will skyrocket from 2021 and onwards for at least a decade. So there will be a booming and prosperous client base for such products taking also into acocunt the newly introduced liberal energy market which demands for accurate day-ahead predictions. So the potential is huge but also much competitions is expected after the first few years. The challenge will be to be able to early come up with our complete solution as envisaged in order to rapidly earn a good market share in the Greek PV market. 
So the plan is to spent first year on research with a small engineering team (maybe 1 addition) to construct the solution without significant revenues, limiting sales during that period to monitoring solutions that can already be const","We have from previous endeavours in developing interactive travel guides for active holidays and GPS path tracking already build a reliable CI/CD software deployment pipeline. Also a dedicated data collection and presentation platform based on Node-RED has been successfully build that can collaborate with multiple Databases like Mongo and timeseries DBs like Quest. Last but not least we have designed and tested a method for selecting  certain strings to be monitored that allow with low cost to have an accurate representation of the physical model of the PV plant continuously adapted to real conditions. This model will be used both in predictions and preventive maintenance in combination with envisaged early defect diagnosis techniques like regular collectionspatio-temporal information from thermal images minimizing also standard maintenance costs reducing also human interventions. the model is currently deployed and tested in one small 100KW park in Goumenissa Kilkis and will be scaled now to 500KW and beyond in a new park currently created in Larissa.

These services are expensive, they don’t fulfil all their needs, and can’t be customized to each organization’s special needs.  

Emails containing important announcements about the company fail to reach dozens of receiving journalists, which has the result of the announcement not being published. 
Reports made by journalists and other stake holders in the media (television, radio, or even webpages) are never seen by the company.  
Positive or negative public audio/video comments by customers on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, or podcasts, are never heard by the company. The same thing often happens even with written comments as well. 

Companies that need media monitoring services and effective publicity management services don’t have the resources required to hire the personnel or to outsource them to outside contractors.  ","In PressWire, we want to solve all the problems mentioned above through a unified Software as a Service solution, utilizing artificial intelligence and adapting voice to text methods in the media monitoring and information management sector. 
We began with the development of a platform that solves the issue of the reliable delivery of corporate press releases. Our press release delivery service it's already functioning today. In the second half of 2021, we want to put into operation new services, which we think will bring a revolution in the sector. The services we plan to integrate into our platform include automatic media monitoring of television and radio broadcasts, informational webpages and social media posts.  After we integrate these functions, which will initially fully support the English and Greek spoken languages for selected television and radio broadcasts, our subscribers will be able to access media monitoring reports that are composed in real time. ","What our competitors are doing manually, with delays, with deficiencies, and at a significant cost to their corporations, we do it more efficiently, in greater numbers, faster, cheaper, and automatically. The developments in voice to text technology will change everything in the media monitoring and information management sector, and in the new world that’s being created, we want PressWire to be a trustworthy partner to small and medium-sized businesses. 
We want to give the opportunity to even very small businesses around the globe to enjoy high quality media monitoring and press management services for very low monthly subscriptions.

","Ex vivo cell culture models stimulate the human immune responses and are personalized for each patient using his own cells. 

1. BAT test for direct – type I allergic reactions. Basophil Test (BasoTEST) is a multidimensional - specific tool for the allergist with greater accuracy compared to skin prick tests. Essentially, this particular test is a process of allergy induction in a test tube using a little blood from the patient without suffering or endangering himself. This method can be used to detect allergies to drugs, foods, insect bites and inhaled allergens as well as to monitor allergic disease.

2. LTT test for hypersensitivity reactions. Drugs, metals, hymenoptera venoms and other allergens. 
LTT is a lymphocyte transformation test (LTT), an ex vivo diagnostic tool, used to detect delayed-type allergic reactions, in which T lymphocytes sensitized by an allergen are transformed and proliferate. when they come into contact with it again.

","By 2025 more than 50% of Europeans will suffer from at least one allergic disease. if Europeans properly diagnosed and treated, 142 € billions will be saved annually.

Until  today, in Greece and more broadly in the Balkan countries, there are no basic methods for the full control of allergies (screening), as is the case with other diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis and many genetically dependent diseases). The main goals are the development of diagnostic methods for the effective diagnosis of all allergic diseases both with high specificity and the coverage of the entire spectrum of allergens. In addition, the specific and early detection of viral infections when they are still at a low load in people with respiratory allergies makes the need imperative to avoid asthma flare-ups and ultimately the death of people.

It is specifically designed to cover the needs of the market and with its unique architecture aims to make grocery shopping easier than ever through online ordering and delivery to the customer's doorstep.
In today's fast-paced world, customers are turning more and more online to cover their day-to-day needs. Lack of time, transportation, or extreme circumstances like the current pandemic and health problems force customers to find solutions that will save them time and effort without compromising on quality which remains the most important factor when doing grocery shopping. At the same time, most local stores like greengrocers, butcheries, fish markets, delicatessens, and stores with organic, traditional, and special diet products lack proper online presence and/or do not have functional e-shops, struggle to compete in the new reality and reach out to this relatively new and fast-growing clientele.
From enhancing the sales procedure to covering even the most special customer needs, stinporta.gr is designed to fill this gap and offer users a unique shopping experience allowing them to easily find products from numerous stores, select the preferred payment method, and the exact time when the products will be delivered to their doorstep, in less than a minute.
","Unlike its competitors Stinporta.gr is specifically and strategically designed to cover the needs of the retail food market. Grocery stores that have been traditionally operating offline and might struggle against the competition (e.g. big super market chains) now have an easy, reliable and affordable way to effectively promote their products and receive orders online. This allows them to expand their clientele and thus increase their turnover. These unique characteristics allow the platform to easily expand and become an attracitive online marketplace with hundreds of shops and thousands of every day and specialised products. At the same time, end-users are able to easily find, order, and have delivered food (or other) products of high quality from their favorite or newly discovered stores in order to cover their needs. These include specialized products that are hard to find in the supermarkets, products offered directly from producers or producing companies, and products to cover their need for a special diet. The result is a personalised seamless shopping experience that provides convenience but also confidence and trust to both retailers and end-users.
","Stinporta.gr is an innovative, intuitive, and highly adaptable platform that has zero requirements for specialized technology infrastructure by the collaborating partners. This has been a driving force towards a rapid expansion and a highly competitive advantage. These assets and the platform’s customer-oriented design are also two of the pillars for its success. End-users can place their order 24/7, select instant or scheduled (up to 7 days) delivery, while being able to customize their order in terms of quantity and share specific requirements with regards to non-packaged products ( e.g. meat, delicacies etc.) In terms of design, the centralized products management architecture is one of the platform’s biggest assets. It leads to high quality content & gives us the possibility to offer extended filtering & a data-driven experience and maintain and utilize extended customer preferences data. Special algorithms will take advantage of these data in order to provide a personalized user experience,  enhance the platform’s usability, speed up the ordering process and provide unique product suggestions. Our own delivery fleet is also expected to be deployed soon so that we can fully handle and ensure the quality of each order. This will allow us to introduce an innovative smart cart service giving users the possibility to order simultaneously from multiple stores while at the same time making it possible for us to pick up goods from stores and get them shipped around the country.","The MVP was initially launched in May 2020 and the first official version of Stinporta.gr was launched in July 2020. During the first 6 months of the platform's operation, we achieved an average of 83% Month over Month growth. As of May 2020, the platform already has over 1000 total registered users and about 90 collaborating stores covering the three major cities of Crete and the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki.

Despite the budget constraints and the low brand recognition of a new online platform and service (especially against well-known competitive brands), stinporta.gr has already managed to overcome most of the well-known online competitive platforms mainly because of its unique, innovative design,  its market orientation, our exclusive partnerships and the platform's high user retention.
","Co-founders: 
Stelios Smaragdakis - CEO, the visionary behind the project, responsible for market research, marketing, overall control, and strategy design while developing the platform's front-end interface. 
Giorgos Keramitzoglou - CTO, the platform's architecture designer and lead developer. 
Filippos Liandrakis - COO, responsible for cooperation management. 

Our experience and expertise combined with hard work and dedication has lead us to build an innovative system which has already gained the trust of both customers and partners. Despite the tight budget, we have successfully managed to overcome major competitive companies, while constantly introducing new features and designing the platform's expansion. Our growth plans include expansion to other big Greek cities and eventually the whole country utilising the lessons learned from previous efforts and existing collaborations. The introduction of the smart cart, products' shipping and further personalisations in combination with an increase in our userbase will create new revenue sources. Moreover, on top of the grocery market, the platform can be opened up to serve new markets such as pet stores, cosmetics stores, pharmacies, and more. Its scope can be also easily expanded in order to cover business transactions (B2B) revolutionizing their supply chain. Finally, the platform and the business logic can be applied to markets outside Greece.","At this stage the company will benefit from a seed investment of 500K EUR. The amount will be invested to cover the needs for highly qualified personnel, speed up the platform's geographical expansion, invest in brand building and marketing and assist in the fast development of new services.

Major derailments and fatal accidents may happen due to human failure or infrequent and improper monitoring systems. Traditionally, track inspection is carried out by human inspectors or via human-operated ground vehicles and involves investigation of various types of rail components and their properties to detect visually noticeable defects, such as missing fasteners, clips, and encroaching vegetation. However, this manual human-operated process is time-inefficient, costly, and complex, while it also incurs a very suboptimal and sparse pattern of observability of tracks. 
StreamOwl provides a novel full-fledged solution for aerial monitoring of railways using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, for railway inspection and identification of defects and anomalies in the structure of the rails. The drone operates in an autonomous unsupervised manner, even in GPS-denied areas, and is able to navigate over a railway track for a long distance, inspect, detect and identify anomalies along the railway (rail defects, fallen leaves, sun kinks, gauge deviation, sideline vegetation etc.), thanks to industry-leading Computer Vision and Deep Learning capabilities.","StreamOwl provides a novel full-fledged solution for aerial monitoring of railways using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, for railway inspection and identification of defects and anomalies in the structure of the rails.

Integrated 3D cameras and peripheral sensors (e.g., lidars, ultrasound sensors) enable adaptive 3D path planning, and safe navigation based on advanced flying capabilities (including collision-avoidance, object detection and target proximity estimation). The provided solution enables faster inspections, large coverage even in adverse conditions, ease of deployment, and safety during operation.","The use of drones instead of ground vehicles (e.g., rovers) is motivated by the need for quick overview, inspection, and large coverage of the railways in adverse terrains, where regular inspection operations cannot be applied, are costly, and time-inefficient. A drone can cover large distances and can overcome possible large obstacles (e.g. fallen trees) on the railway (while a rover cannot go through a large tree that has fallen on the rails). Drones are also easier to deploy since they can be carried in a typical passenger car and they do not interfere with the normal operation of the trains as they fly above the train level (~3-20m above the ground).t
StreamOwl has developed a UAV with a programmable flight controller that enables route planning in an autonomous non-supervised manner and an on-board companion computer and 3D cameras to record, scan, and analyze vegetation along the railway in real-time. A set of sensors (lidar, ultrasonic sensor) allow the adaptation of the route to slopes, the avoidance of obstacles and collisions, and the automatic adaptation of the route in every terrain.t  
Moreover, the UAV is powered by industry-leading AI skills based on advanced Computer Vision and Deep-Learning capabilities which enable the detection and identification of anomalies and problems along the railway lines (objects, fallen trees/leaves, sun kinks, gauge deviation, etc.) and 3D cartography of encroaching vegetation.t

Sunlight.io is bringing new products to the market that help to redefine what high performance cloud and virtualisation is really about, transforming the market with a suite of products implemented for on-premise enterprise infrastructure, in the cloud via AWS baremetal services and at the edge for remote resource constrained environments.","The Sunlight.io Enterprise Software Platform is a hyper-converged IaaS system optimized to provide the highest I/O and networking performance for virtualized workloads, using Virtual Machines or containers. It is built on top of the “NexVisor”, a next-generation hypervisor stack, designed and optimized to support today’s high performance hardware technologies with almost zero overhead, delivering a whole new paradigm in virtual IO performance. 
The Sunlight.io Enterprise Software Platform is a hyper-converged infrastructure system based on Sunlight.io’s new Hypervisor technology purpose-built for the cognitive workload era, offering increased performance and minimized costs for virtualized workloads either on premise or in cloud. Sunlight.io provides a complete hyperconverged stack – including hypervisor, software defined storage and software defined networking components – all designed for providing the maximum possible speed.","1) Unified virtualization layer for both datacenter (Cloud) and Edge nodes, implemented as an advanced virtualization platform. Edge virtualization refers to virtualizing compute, memory, storage, and networking resources of the edge nodes, in order to allow applications to run on the edge infrastructure without being aware of the actual hardware and also to manage resource efficiently through software-defined abstractions for storage and networking. 2) Resource management within the local Cloud infrastructure and realization of a distributed resource management approach including the Edge-side resources, embracing all sites participating in the distributed architecture. Enable cross-testbed site resource scheduling that will: a) maintain distributed monitoring information on the resource status and policy mode of each testbed site accessible to participating entities, b) act in an autonomous, distributed manner that will utilize the available cross-site monitoring and prediction information to enforce the specified scheduling policies and ensure availability and stable operation (e.g. avoid faulty servers or networks). Sunlight.io has entered a competitive market, currently dominated by large companies, such as AWS, VMware, Microsoft (Azure) and several other companies. However, given its synergies with the same companies, they are also its collaborators. ","January 2019 - Initial creation of the Sunlight technology prototype – achieved 1 Million IOPs fully virtualized
January 2020 - First major GA release to market for production customers
January 2020 - First major edge customer deployment using Sunlight technology (Lavazza)
April 2020 - Reached 30 employees
August 2020 - Incorporation of the Greek Sunlight company to support growth and investment into the engineering team in Greece
October 2020 - First major datacenter build commitment using Sunlight technology (Eschercloud)
November 2020 - New investors joined the board (Bosch and OpenOcean)
March 2021 - Reached 40 employees
","Julian Chesterfield, founder and CEO, was one of the team that built the first Open Source hypervisor, Xen in 2003. The edge market is growing fast with very few compelling commercial solutions available today. The incumbent HCI products from VMWare and Nutanix were never designed to be able to operate on constrained hardware and extreme edge operating environments. Sunlight therefore has a significant advantage with a solution that is 1/5 of the footprint and 10x the performance of the alternatives.
Cloud is another important growth area.  Barriers to growth potential would be development lag, partner adoption, and circumstances such as covid. Sunlight.io is offering new technologies to different markets and is growing its customer base by reaching more diversified customers, in international and European markets. Sunlight.io platform developments are aiming at building new/enhanced services geared to support multiple, heterogeneous clouds. Sunlight.io also plans to analyze the emerging requirements from the Big-data and 5G domains through the implementation of market-specific use-cases, in order to enrich its current solutions to meet users’ needs and also address potential customers’ issues related to lower operational expenditure (OPEX), lower total cost of ownership (TCO) and better energy efficiency.",Sunlight primarily sells through partners who install our solution onto their hardware.

Parents everywhere face the same problem: children require a constant supply of clothing (€800/household/year), and the clothes they outgrow are worth hundreds/thousands of euros. This is lost value to parents, with no convenient way to recover it. So they donate, or accumulate!
Our value proposition is as follows:
- We provide an easy solution for parents to cash in that value, by swapping what they have, for what they need. They are essentially paying for clothes, with clothes. 
- We provide a shopping site with carefully selected and freshly washed items. This is clothing in great condition at seriously discounted prices. The site is open to everyone (no need to send in clothes in order to buy).
- When parents combine the above, they save 80-90% compared to buying new.
- We offer multiple brands on our site, so they don’t need to place orders on multiple sites.
- We provide an easy and profitable way to declutter their homes.
- They don’t need to leave their homes at any point in their journey. Everything is done online and with couriers.
- Last but certainly not least, they significantly reduce their carbon and water footprints. 
","Problems: 
1. Children require a constant supply of clothing (~20 items/child/year), at a household cost of €800/year. Meanwhile, the clothes they leave behind are often in great condition, representing significant value, with no easy way to monetise them. They also create clutter.
2. The textile sector is the 2nd highest polluter (10% of CO2) and has a massive water footprint (~2,700 litre/T-shirt).
Who: parents of children aged 0-14
Why? Reduce parent's clothing budget; make quality clothing more affordable/accessible; reduce textile waste; reduce CO2 emissions; reduce water consumption
We created a platform that allows parents to easily monetise their kids' closets, and use the earnings to shop for high-quality and washed pre-owned clothes, all without leaving their home. Parents are paid in our shop currency (Planets) so they're captive to our site, spending their earnings there. Clothes are picked up and delivered by courier, and sorted and washed by us, so parents only need to fill a bag and start shopping.
The alternatives are donations to friends/family (no monetisation, needs luck) or selling individually (time-consuming). But they still need to buy new (expensive).
","The combination of the below is our “secret sauce”.
Back-end: This is the technology behind the scenes that enables us to receive and trace thousands of pieces of clothing. We built this ourselves with off-the-shelf tools, for two reasons: to avoid early development costs, and to make quick iterations ourselves until we have a solid back-end. Once we’re happy with the specs, we’ll ask a developer to build custom software.  
Front-end: This is the website designed and built around exactly what parents need. We are parents ourselves and speak to customers daily, to make sure they have a great user experience. We improve our website continuously. As with the back-end, we built it ourselves, and will create a custom website soon (that communicates seamlessly with our back-end).
Marketing analytics and automation: This is key for our business and takes months to build. We track where our customers are in their journey and nudge them forwards. This is especially important for us as parents may be skeptical about second-hand clothing, until they receive our thoughtful packaging and hold (and smell!) the clothes. That’s when they realize that they don’t need to compromise quality or condition.

We are a young company of like-minded associates who firmly aspire to play a catalytic role in “Industry 4.0” - the so-called fourth industrial revolution, brought on by the rapid expansion and broad availability of innovative industrial technologies.

More specifically, we have created Synthetica to develop and market innovative value-enhancing process optimization tools relying on advanced data-capture and predictive Artificial Intelligence (A.I) models.

Synthetica has won contracts and has built strong client relationships with leading international players, and can demonstrate a track record of long-term revenues in the following sectors:

•Logistics 
•Maritime
•Aerospace
•Public / Private Sector Digitization","At its core, Synthetica’s mission is to address issues of low productivity and capped efficiencies in businesses with asset-heavy industrial/infrastructure installed bases. Typically, most of these businesses tend to suffer from long-term structural performance limitations owing to: 

1.tLargely non-digitalized processes, resulting in heavier-than-needed human involvement. 
2.tInertia and limited reactivity due to low IoT (internet of Things) connectivity in the business model 
3.tLoss of opportunity due to non-efficient information mining and sharing

Synthetica designs, produces and installs proprietary software solutions specifically to remove these issues and upgrade processes for the A.I / M.L and IoT era, at a fraction of the cost required to install new hardware. It does so by leveraging the vast amount of data that both legacy and modern asset bases can generate, capture and store in ‘intelligent’ databases.  This amount of data, if analyzed on time and correctly, can lead to significant efficiency benefits.","At the core of this business model stand the twin concepts of scalability and operating leverage:

•Scalability: base product designed upfront to address needs of multiple potential clients 
•Operating leverage: limited customization costs for on selling of products to new clients

Synthetica’s SaaS business model provides for significant growth potential as the product development process is specifically designed to maximize implementation adaptability and minimize new client onboarding costs. Synthetica designs, develops, and delivers industrial /infrastructure Mission Critical software services relying on a SaaS model with:

1.Huge addressable market comprising of both new and legacy asset bases with ever-increasing data harvesting needs and limited current supply of AI/ML solutions
2.High scalability due to ‘smart’ business model where development costs are covered with the first contract whilst on-sell efforts require limite

The company's products are entirely proprietary and almost completely based on innovation. All apps and platforms are developed in-house, so as to provide full customisation, and with few rare exceptions, no outside or existing code libraries are used. Synthetica's own M.L engineers develop specific solutions for specific client problems. In addition, the company, through its client base, has exclusive access to otherwise unavailable datasets for the training of its algorithms, which ensures the competitive advantage of its products.
","Although founded only 2,5 years ago, the company has already managed to achieve significant milestones, such as: 

•tRecurring revenue and successful up-sells from 4 industry leaders (including the largest Dry Cargo shipping company currently listed in the NY Stock Exchange). 
•tNew pilots already under execution for clients across 3 new sector verticals (clients include publicly listed companies and sector leaders)
•tInternational recognition gained as a specialized AI/ML supplier in the industrial/infrastructure space, selected to participate in a prestigious EU-Funded technological development project (in partnership with aerospace giant Thales)
•Award of EU structural-fund technology subsidy
•Growth of team and office space, including establishment of new office in Cyprus
•Word-of-mouth clients and highly positive feedback from market","Synthetica’s team consists of careful selection of stakeholders, at the head of which are the company’s two founders, that combine Tech Startup experience with a unique background of highly relevant scientific knowledge

Founder A - CEO: 
•tRepeat Tech Entrepreneur
•tFounder of Engineering Startup (UAV services provider)
•tSuccessful development and exit through sale to logistics multinational company
•tMechanical Engineer with experience in large infrastructure projects (Middle East) 

Founder B - CTO: 
•tMSc in Applied Mathematics (National Technical University of Athens)
•tMSc in Data Science (Athens University of Economics and Business)
•tExtensive specialization on Machine Learning & Fluid Dynamics applications 
•tDeveloper of groundbreaking Computer Vision & Satellite Image analysis software 

In addition to the management team, the company currently employs 10 developers and engineers in the following roles: 

•tData Scientists
•tData Engineers
•tBackend Engineers
•tFrontend Engineers
•tEmbedded Hardware/Software Engineer
•tDevOps Engineer
•tNaval Engineer

Synthetica is collaborating with leading academic institutions in the content of which it currently employs 3 Data Science Engineers in internship positions. Historically the company has a strong conversion rate, having hired 2 employees from previous internship rounds. ","The company has identified a number of priority “needs” for new products, most of them requested by the clients themselves.  Based on its experience to date, Synthetica foresees significant value and returns potential in building an interchangeable “components library” that will allow the delivery of innovative solutions , with limited on-sell customization costs. 

The company has therefore prepared the relevant product development plan and earmarked the corresponding requirement in additional funds. This funding round will provide the company with the necessary resources for investments in Data Science Engineering, Application and Product Development resources in general  - and for the components library in particular - as well as the strengthening of its marketing team.

They are in industries such as construction, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation. These individuals make up the ""Deskless Workforce"" - a 2.7 billion-person strong portion of the global working population. 
Despite being 80% of the workforce, these workers are currently underserved by technology. In fact, they are 13 times less digitally engaged than the office workers, while 83% of them do not even have a corporate email address. 

This causes difficulties for multiple stakeholders: 

(a) Deskless Workers. They are working with disperse means resulting to time-consuming processes, reduced productivity, and often erroneous information input. 
(b) Managers. Gaining control over their operations is hard, valuable information for most processes is missed or is hard to analyze. 
(c) Enterprises. Enterprises are unable to integrate into their digital strategy their deskless personnel to enable them to flourish and remain competitive.","Tekmon has developed a software solution designed to boost frontline teams’ productivity, through the rapid, no-code digitization of processes. More specifically:

(a) Deskless Workers. Are equipped with a powerful tool that helps them work smarter, not harder.
(b) Managers. Gain control over their operations. Increase productivity and improve their processes.
(c) Enterprises. A solution to propagate the enterprise’s digital strategy across the workforce.

Tekmon's platform streamlines business processes with minimal set-up time and training in 3 simple steps: 

[Step 1] Digitize the work environment. Create digital twins of physical and human resources, such as locations, assets, parts, products, workforce, and suppliers. 

[Step 2] Create Custom Processes. Pick one of the process builder tools available, such as work orders, digital forms & checklists, production orders, emergency alerting, remote training etc. Build your custom processes with a few drags, drops & clicks, ie maintenance plans, quality control checks, production plans, emergency responses, safety inductions, worksite access, and more.

[Step 3]. Go mobile. Specifically designed for challenging environments. The entire workforce remains connected, wherever they are. Enable collaboration, automate processes, reduce risk, gain visibility, and boost productivity.
","Tekmon reinvents the way frontline deskless employees perform their duties similarly to Slack, Jira, and Microsoft Teams are doing for office employees.

We speed up comprehensive systems development in those sectors with less cost,  ensuring adaptation to industry standards and we tackle the scarcity of development resources needed.
","The strategic product of TEN06 is the innovative TEN06 Business Block (BBlock), addressed to SMEs of the Travel and Agricultural industries. BBlocks are autonomous and flexible applications to be used as building blocks, allowing fast development of comprehensive and individualized applications. 

Different BBlocks are in the pipeline of development to address requirements that are common between enterprises of each target domain.
The first TEN06 Ferry content BBlock has been developed for the Ferry industry to provide a ready-to-use application managing the content needed for Travel agencies, addressing the growing needs for more digital content and the fast adaptation to frequent variations due to changes of commercial policies or regulations. It includes implemented source APIs which can be extended according to the needs of the client, the mechanism that homogenizes the content according to the industry business flows, along with a registry database and interfaces to 3rd party systems (e.g. accounting). They are cloud based, using appropriate technologies for increased security and performance. It is parameterized to cover individual's needs and offered in different flavors to cover needs of OnLine Travel Agencies, marketplaces and medium-sized traval professionals. ","The innovation of TEN06 BBlocks is the combination of business knowledge, practical know how and technology that leads to elimination of complexity (time, uncertainty, lack of resources) to build business applications. 
BBlocks cover needs that are common in multiple players in an industry of focus (travel& tourism, agriculture), introduce the modularity and flexibility needed to cover particular needs of each client and support the interoperability with other application components to build fully functional systems.

In the travel sector, we emphasize in ferries and daily activities. We target professionals in Europe: (a) large OnLineTravel Agencies who wish to include Ferry or daily activities in their booking engines, (b) marketplaces or travel platforms, (b) medium-sized travel agencies.

In the agricultural area, the BBlocks address the interoperability needed in traceability and the interface between digital farming and MISs. We target large large farmers, cooperatives and food industries from Greece. 
","Within its 18months of operation, the company set its business model, set the foundmentals of its operation and has already started marketing its products and services. 
The company employs 5 people (incl 4 developers) and established  a branch in N.Greece. 

TEN06 formed a strategic alliance with the consulting firm ena growth consultants in order to share know-how and formulate the needs of the agriculture industry through their 3.500 clients of primary and secondary sectors, which eventually will lead to the design of corresponding BBlocks.  

The TEN06 FerryBBlock has been developed. The company undertakes the development of the booking  engine of an OnLineTravel Agent. The TEN06BBlock for daily activities has been designed.

The creation of a global knowledge company, from the ""cooperation"" of Man and Machine through Artificial Intelligence:
 
 • A company where the brain will be a combination of Artificial Intelligence Brain with the Human   Brain.
 • A company with a very strong R&D for the creation of constantly innovative products.
 • A company to which it applies: ""We can compute everything that can be computed"".
 • A company on the verge of human and machine integration.
 And above all: A company for the good of Humanity
","The problem our software solves is the optimal selection of stock portfolios, for all stock exchanges worldwide using the combined methods of the three applicable theories 
A.tFundamentals Analysis, 
B.tPortfolio Selection H. Markowitz- Nobel, C. Advanced methods  Technical Analysis using Neural Networks).
 
 International development has two dimensions:

 A) Portfolio selection technology.

 B) Technology of artificial intelligence algorithms, for the solution of the above issues: Neural networks, Data mining etc.

 We consider that we are in the state of the art of the sector as well as with great progress in the research of the relevant topics

 The product has three forms:
 • As a Software Package for all stock exchanges
 • As a Platform, which can be run remotely by each customer-user, with all parameters
 • As a Report sale for all G20 Stock Exchanges, for each Stock Exchange separately, for portfolios with risk specifications and behavior until ""now"" desirable in return.
"," • The software makes combined use, at the same time, of all three theories that exist for the selection of stocks (Fundamental Analysis, Portfolio Selection and Technical Analysis) with connecting elements of appropriate optimisations that do not exist anywhere until today.  Nor is it possible for them to be copied, since it is not clear what they are doing.
 • The software contains a machine learning system, which learns, for each stock market, how it works, ""its secrets"", and indicates the profitable portfolios.  The system we have developed is impossible to exist elsewhere due to the many individual secrets it contains and which one cannot copy due to lack of understanding.
 • The stock selection process is based on selected strategies.  There are strategies, such as the so-called strategy B, which is not described anywhere, is a big secret and of course can not be copied.
 • Specially developed by us, test for checking the existence of information in the rules of selection of shares, to avoid inappropriate buying and selling
 • Mechanical evaluation of any Investor Portfolio and optimisation proposals
 With all the above, we occupy a strategic position in the market (as defined), ie a position that can not be copied, or can not be easily copied, which is our comparative advantage.  Like all innovative companies: Occupying a strategic position in the market.
","Important points - milestones in the business and scientific history of the company so far are: Industrial Research:
 • Main research: Finding a way to build a portfolio from the data of the calculations and the Markowitz front.  The decision was to continue, as the investigation was successful.
 • Research on the combined use of the three theories of the Stock Exchange, with ""connective tissue"", scale optimisations, as well as the use of A.I.
 • Method of finding the existence of information in sales rules or noise detection.
 •… all the innovations, were found with hypotheses and confirmations with A.I.
 
 
Despite the fact that we are a new company, we have the first paying customers from Greece and abroad, while the interest is constantly increasing:
 
 • Thr original form of the software was installed in the bank DENIZBANK in Istanbul.
 • In the same form it was bought by investment organisations in Greece (ETEVA insurance fund etc.)
 • There is interest from universities.
","The growth of our company in the coming years which is based on cutting-edge technologies, according to our investment plan will be explosive of 100% per year.
 
The method of entering and developing the market will be gradual, per new stock exchange to provide software products and services, as well as per new product and/or extensions of the original ones.
 
We have started with the shares participating in the S&P500 and EUROXX600 indices.
We will continue with their G20 stock market equivalents.
Then for the Bond Markets, the ETF’s, for Coins and for Cryptocoins.
After the beginning for all the shares and not the shares that participate in the main world indices
There will be long-term growth, due to the global availability of the innovative product and the ongoing needs in the sector, ""the sky is the limit""!

We are bringing nature back to agriculture, by shaping a greener future using Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. We envision farmers as strategic planners, able to make strategic farming decisions provided by our AI algorithms, based on  a vast amount of collected and processed field data.
“Every year weeds destroy enough food to feed 1 billion people. Not only this but we must produce more food over the next 50 years than we did over the last 500 years. We believe we can solve the weed control problem, for both conventional and organic farmers, leveraging Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.” 
We provide a state-of-the-art solution for organic weeding through our fully electric and autonomous agricultural robot platform. In modern agriculture, the rapidly growing field of agricultural robots deeply participates in the integrated crop management and this is highly aligned with our goal to contribute to the weed control problem through precision agriculture and herbicides usage minimization.
","Our product is a fully electric and autonomous robotic platform, able to navigate autonomously in row crop fields and execute mechanical or laser weeding using state-of-the-art Robotic and Artificial Intelligence technologies. We automatize weed management while maintaining a highly organic and time-effective method that helps farmers to efficiently and effectively control weeds at any time with absolute respect to the environment. The mechanical weeding task is executed by the Passive Row Cultivator covering areas between the plant rows (inter-row), as the robot navigates autonomously within the crop rows. The laser weeding is been executed with very high precision through very accurate weed detections and treats the weeds with a high-energy laser beam. The weeding task can be executed in different crops such as potato, cotton, aromatic and medicinal plants, and baby leaf crops as the robot can navigate into fields with different geometries due to its adjustable width chassis. ","Our robot is a multi-functional tool in modern farming and especially in green and organic farming. We call it multi-functional because except for the weed management our autonomous robot could perform other tasks including crop measurements, data collection and analysis, and carrying existing farming equipment as it can also act as a farmers’ “digital twin”. The problems that we deal with are the Autonomous Navigation, the Safety and Consistent operation of the robot, the development of a user friendly interface to interact and communicate with the robot as also the implementation of robust and extendable AI algorithms for perception, detection and decision making. We also face big challenges regarding the mechanical and electronic parts of our robot as it operates in harsh environments under tough conditions and we are willing to provide a robust and safe certified robot to our customers.
","We are happy to see that our idea is fully aligned with the EU's green deal vision. Since our company registration we have participated in several AgriTech Business competitions and we are excited to see our idea as a finalist in almost all of them.
 
Specifically, 
- 6th Annual John & Mary Pappajohn Business Plan Award: Top-5 Overall - Granted financial award
- Trophy-Τροφή Challenge: Top-10 finalist in AgriTech Startups

In parallel with the above efforts we have created two robot prototypes - a proof of concept one and the second which is a real scale autonomous robot able to navigate in real field conditions. Currently we are finalizing the design and development of our MVP and we are about to have our first pilotic trials at the end of 2023.","Our competitive advantage is that we provide an easy-to-use, flexible, modular and an all weather heavy duty weeding solution supported and developed by our highly specialized team. Our team consists of experts in Automotive, Embedded Systems, Mechatronics, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence as well as Agronomy and Economics. Our core members have great technical and managerial experience in large-scale projects by working for several years with top-tier companies in the Automotive and Software sectors like Porsche AG, AUDI AG, Continental AG, Taboola, ZOOX, etc. Finally, one of the most important factors of Terra Robotics' great potential is that its key members are active in the agriculture business and especially in Medicinal & Aromatic crops for many years, so we not only have direct access to test fields but we have identified the problems from our team members’ own experience.
","For the future of our project, we strongly believe that we have to use a national or EU funding program as such a choice will provide us with great supporting benefits regarding the funding and specifically the salary expenses and the supply of various needed equipment.

Main activities:
Heat to power applications with advanced architecture ORC units
High temperature heat pumps
Heat transfer solutions for individual industrial applications
","Large amounts of excess heat are wasted in various processes with the waste heat recovery market experiencing a high growth globally. This market concerns the further utilisation of waste heat with the most mainstream techniques being the re-use of this heat or its conversion to power. Nevertheless, it is commonly known that power cannot be extracted in an efficient and cost-effective manner from low temperature heat. Within this temperature range, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is currently the prevailing heat-to-power conversion technology. The ORC market is growing fast during the last years, reaching almost 3 GW of total installed capacity, especially biomass and industrial heat recovery projects, revealing the potential of these sectors. However, there are few commercial products with limited number of sales for low temperature heat sources (below 150 oC) and small sizes applications (i.e. below 50 kW), due to both ORC high cost and low performance. 
The new product aims to address the challenging low-grade waste heat market, by bridging the stipulated gap between “cost” and “performance”. The core objective is to finalise the development and commercialize an innovative heat-to-power engine with a novel volumetric expansion machine that approaches the isothermal expansion process. From the thermodynamics’ theory, it is well known that when a gas is expanded (almost) isothermally, the maximum possible work is produced. This high thermal content of the expanded gas can be fur","The startup as a spin-off company owns innovative characteristics that have been acknowledged during the university’s internal assessment procedure. The main unique selling propositions (USP) are directly related to the innovative features of the new product, as highlighted in the previous sections, resulting to the following USP:
•tHigher efficiency by about 25% than competing ORC products (e.g. ORCAN, Enogia, etc.)
•tReduced price per produced kWe than competing solutions.
•tA PBP of even 2-3 years, increasing the profitability of the end-users and attractive to invest.
•tNo limitation for integration to existing biogas-CHP units, still offering heat of adequate temperature.
•tHigh modularity due to the use of multiple expanders to address a large range of applications and sizes.
•tHigh flexibility for operating at CHP or power-only mode.","The important achievements/milestones are:
•tThermoDraft was recognised and established as a spin-off of the Agricultural University of Athens (AUA), meaning that fully fulfils the relevant innovation criteria set by the legal framework.

It is widely accepted that snorkelers and divers prefer biological attributes of the marine environment, while they show higher preference for fish abundance and fish size over corals. The establishment of artificial reefs favors biological productivity, thus enhancing the local populations of fish and invertebrates, especially in biologically depleted areas of the seabed. As the trend of creating Recreational Diving Parks increases globally, the appeal of ARs is critical for their ability to attract marine ecotourism but also to divert visitor pressure from natural reefs.

The variability between fast and slow paths can reach up to 80%. This affects the performance because each digital operation must wait the slowest path (critical path). The problem of delay variability will continue to exist and increase in the future according to Moore's law. The industry is tackling this problem by developing new shrinking technologies in semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to achieve better specifications in terms  of performance and power consumption as expressed by the metric performance per watt. A transition  to a smaller manufacturing dimension achieves an improvement in performance/watt of 15-25%. However these technologies have huge development costs and in addition the transistor shrinking capabilities are expected to reach their limit by 2030. ,Trimsignal’s solution incorporates a chip in the existing processor that adjusts the processor’s speed by detecting in real time which of the slower paths are active. Thus a processor can operate at several frequencies above nominal achieving a speed improvement of 35-60%. At the same time this technology allows to reduce the power consumption by reducing the voltage supply. Although the voltage reduction increases the propagation delay in the slower paths the impact on the speed is absorbed by the achieved acceleration achieving an improvement in performance/watt of 18-30% which competitive to the improvement that the shrinking technologies provide and considering the zero design and manufacturing cost as the original design remains unchanged. An additional benefit is the ability of the versioning of the original design while the operating specifications can be modified emphasizing on the speedup or power consumption based on the targeted product by incorporating the appropriate hardware.,"An innovative digital design method that increases performance in digital devices up to 20-65% or decreases power up to 15-40% in any IC design. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only non-manufacturing technique that improves performance-per-watt (P/W) without a migration to a new manufacturing technology or a stressing of the device’s operation margins that ensure reliability. Each new chip technology improves the performance-per-watt (P/W) in average 15-25%, doubling the fab, the R&D, the design, the EDA and the market costs. The proposed approach provides an improvement 15-40% P/W, adjusting the clock signal at runtime without any cost. Considering the chip-shrinking technological deadlock for the next decades the proposed solution seems even more attractive. The innovation is outlined in the following condition: “If the critical circuit paths that bound the performance of a digital device, retain stable or inactive (their propagation is interrupted), they will not represent an operating frequency constraint.” A hardware-based scheduler exploits this condition boosting the device frequency without triggering errors. The critical paths’ detection is implemented before the passing of the chip’s combinational logic while a glitch-free clock multiplexer imports a new operating frequency without losing in transitional clock cycles, respecting the setup and the hold times. The proposed solution can be applied to any digital device, regardless complexity or size. ",The submission of the first patent began very early in 2016 as a provisional patent application at the US patent office In order to explore the potential of our technology we had the opportunity to speak  with companies in Silicon Valley like Xilinx  and after realizing the prospects of our technology we submitted the final applications along with the US patent office to the international patent organization WIPO two years later.

We provide an all-in-one guest experience platform which enables top-tier hotels and luxury vacation rental businesses to streamline their booking process for experiences and ancillary services and automate communication with suppliers and guests, with the ultimate goal of increasing guest engagement and spending. With our expansive international customer roster, our company is making experiential travel more accessible than ever!","With Triparound, travel professionals replace complex legacy software and manual processes with a sophisticated all-in-one solution. Our key philosophy is to act as the umbrella to manage and track all experience and ancillary services of a hospitality business, unlocking the intersection between experiential travel and convenience. More specifically, Triparound works as an all-in-one central hub for hotels to add, manage, and promote all their experiences and ancillary services – beyond the room. Similarly, vacation rental companies can leverage our intuitive platform to offer bespoke experiences to their customers, bringing 5-star hotel luxury to their home away from home. With Triparound technology, a business is equipped with an easy-to-use tool that allows them to centralize their ecosystem of ancillary services in one place across all product types, distribute and promote these services through multiple channels, manage all bookings with one-click action buttons and automated communications, and build and share tailor-made flexible travel itineraries. All relevant data is centrally collected, stored and available for analysis – providing significant business value in powering strategic decision making, planning business initiatives, and structuring guest loyalty programs. ","Triparound offers complete management of ancillary services within a single digital environment. We synchronize the booking process amongst multiple stakeholders, allowing our customers to effectively deliver services to their customers. 
Integrations are critical for the formation of a compact technology stack. We have built an abstract architectural layer that operates as a central Channel Manager for all integrations with third-party systems. This architectural layer is designed to integrate simultaneously with multiple third-party applications via a communication layer that acts as a mediator allowing each application to interact with Triparound’s core. This layer properly handles data transformation, connectivity, message routing, and communication protocol conversions. As a result, multiple external applications and systems using different protocols seamlessly integrate with Triparound, resulting in healthier system scalability and management of integrations, and improved user experience. 
Further, Triparound’s architecture is based on a Microservice architecture, consisting of a collection of smaller, autonomous services which are self-contained and address unique business needs. This architecture enables the Triparound platform to be modular, ensuring the continuity of operations since each service works independently and can be built and deployed separately; and scalable, as each service can be scaled up horizontally to meet specific computing or processing demands. ","In early 2019 our first collaboration began with internationally renowned Sani-Ikos Resorts. By August we had generated $50K+ revenue for our customers. In November we secured $1,2M seed funding from a team of angel investors from Silicon Valley, verifying our efforts and plan for Triparound. In March 2020, we topped-up our seed round reaching $2M in total funding.
Despite the global pandemic that followed, we continued to grow our customer base and in September 2020 we acquired our first international customer, Ikos Andalusia in Spain. Later that year we onboarded Cabo Villas in the US and by the end of 2020 we had generated $1.8M+ total revenue for our customers, with over 120K bookings made. 
In early 2021 we expanded our partnership with Costa Navarino, bringing on their Golf and Residence businesses, and demonstrating our solution’s ability to act as a solid umbrella software. Our expansion in Latin America followed with Fasano Group joining our customer roster in April. In December we partnered with AMAN Resorts and closed the year reaching $8.2M+ revenue generated for our customers, with over 580K bookings made for 1.2M guests!
In March 2022 we reached the 100 customers’ mark and successfully established ourselves as the go-to software for VR companies, with new customer Nocturne Luxury Villas, a major VR player in the West. By December we had reached $25M+ total revenue generated for our customers, counting over 1.4M bookings made, for 2.7M guests!

Even though we are operating in a saturated market with a vast amount of online courses and tutoring apps out there. Still, it is difficult to find the right solution for the right situation, as those courses are designed to give a huge amount of content in a very generic fashion. They provide knowledge that most people have already acquired or can simply search online. However, what happens if you want to apply that generic knowledge in a specific circumstance or a project you are working on, and the time  is pressing. How do you make something generic, more specific. Searching into online groups and communities may help, but it will definitely take time and the answers do not guarantee quality. 
That is exactly the gap in the market that we found and are trying to tackle. We are the only ones who offer an unparalleled combination of personalized training, connecting users to THE right expert, and providing cost-effective marketing for those experts.","The challenge is, that when users are faced with complex problems on their daily lives, they end up spending hours trying to find the right answers online. Most of the times in vein.
Even though there are experts out there who can solve these exact problems blindfolded.
Through the fuzz of the internet though, it is difficult to connect these two types of users, and there is no way to find the right specialist to solve a specific problem that one may face. There is way too much information out there which sometimes is not valid.

Even if these users find the right platform, chances are, they are still going to have to go through whole lists to find the right specialist for their case. Because those platforms are poorly curated.

With Troosh, we are making it possible to find the right expert in just minutes. while the experts gain value by being effortlessly promoted to broader clients. So they can focus on what matters most, providing knowledge.","We are live! This exiting-for-the-users journey starts with our website. Which supports an intuitive QnA platform and optimizes access. making it quick and easy to identify the experts a user may want to connect with.

A simple click of a button, is all it takes to make things move forward...

On the one hand is a struggling user with a problem or troubling question who is willing to pay money to finally get a solution. On the other hand, there is an expert who is trying to offer the perfect solution, but has trouble finding qualified clientele.

instead of the user having to dig up that expert, all they have to do is go onto our platform, type in their question or problem that they are facing as specifically as possible; and the Machine Learning capabilities that we have developed will identify and match them with the best expert as a solution to their problem! Taking into account the community, the expertise, and the time needed for the given solution. And… that’s it! After that they can immediately jump onto a 1-on-1 online meeting. Saving both time, energy, and sometimes money for the users.","We are already building the expert roster to be able to solve these kinds of problems. And we have done that by becoming active members in major tech forums and communities, where we find our users. We are currently focusing on Software Engineers as our go-to, niche market. But, we also have some use cases about the fitness and psychology communities. Who have shown interest in our service and are using it for their sessions.

As far as the business model is concerned, we are receiving a commission-based (30%) from the payments that the users make to the experts.","If you are wondering why are we the perfect team to reinvent the EdTech marketplace. Well, other than the passion that we have, we know the competitive landscape; we’ve all spent too much time online always trying to find the right answers to specific questions and there are no viable solutions out there like ours, and we are really excited to be able to offer this type of capability. We know the startup ecosystem, as we have collaborated and built a strong bond as a team in previous projects.
We’ve of course hit a number of roadblocks but we don’t care, we just figure out a way around it and continue forward to that path, because we really believe in what we are building.
Our team is comprised of three co-founders. With respective expertise in the departments of marketing, finance, and IT.","We’ve been self-funded since we launched last year and have already produced some beta tests with experts and users. And through them we released the first versions of our app and the QnA website.

We are currently trying to raise a round of 100,000 euros to help us in our marketing efforts, operations, and the expansion within the Greek market and grow the communities we have developed so far. It will also serve as an initial boost for subsequent funding rounds, through which we aim to have a broader expansion in Europe and expand to newer communities as well.

We have developed a novel technology that allows the robot toy to understand the real world with an accuracy of 3 mm and move precisely on the storyboard.

These stories comprise of fantastical virtual worlds and human-esq virtual humans using innovative software and pipelines that bring audiences into the shoes of main characters to experience their journey first-handedly and be trasnformed through inspirational and empowering story. UME creates value by developing and producing original content as well as adaptable content based on internationally acclaimed material, including books, media stories, and scripts, with a franchiseable hook across all traditional, streaming, gaming, and web3.0 platforms.","UME is positioned to fill the gap in the marketplace because of its expertise in combining gaming and cinema via the game engine and virtual production. Its experienced and comprehensive team with over 30 years of transferred “know-how” can deliver games, VR/AR experiences, cinematics shot in the Unreal Game Engine, the leading game engine. UME’s full team of contracted artist, programmers, and developers are currently developing content for distribution across platforms (i.e. Oculus, Steam, Console). This enables us to train and educate Greek artists using our team. 

UME also services other clients by creating 3D virtual worlds, digital humans, and digital assets for film and television shot inside LED stages via virtual production technology. UME created the Amazon series, called FATHEAD, gaining a first-mover advantage and hands-on expertise along the top players in the industry. By leveraging this experience, we also expanded our network bringing know-how and business to Greece.","UME is an innovative creative studio by the transferred knowledge of its team and its unique business model. We don’t just make games, we look to the future to develop powerful stories, fantastical worlds, and humanistic digital characters that can become video games, VR/AR/XR experiences, movies, films, NFT’s and in the Metaverse. 

First, UME’s experienced founder and team possess a deep expertise in the Unreal Game Engine, the most powerful game engine, delivering high quality content with innovative solutions. UME is creating unique plug-ins/tools to enhance content, production timeliness and customize characters for Metahuman software. It creates asset modularity, AI procedural assets and interoperability for multi-platforms use and the Metaverse. 

Second, UME has a unique business model scalable across gaming, film, and episodic tv series using exclusively the game engine. By creating the intellectual property, 3D digital assets, worlds, and digital humans, UME can use the same assets across industries in parallel productions (i.e. a game can be developed with a film because the assets are the same). This lowers production timelines, costs while reaching gaming and film audiences. The value proposition offered to the customers is the creation of virtual worlds and characters with a longer product life-cycle. The Web 3.0 and the Meta will allow digital assets for merchandising and sale as non-fungible tokens (i.e. NFT’s) on marketplaces as additional revenue streams.   ","UME is currently in production on STAY ALIVE MY SON, a virtual reality video game based on an acclaimed French book with a powerful and impressive cast. In 2020, the project was a Cannes Official Selection, in the Development Showcase and an official selection at VIFF, the largest volumetric film festival in the world. Currently, this high-profile VR film and game will be produced and completed in Greece, hiring Greek artists to support local growth. Chapter 1 was released and was an Official Selection at the Venice Film Festival 2022.

UME created an augmented mobile application for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) graduation. We created a virtual world of MIT and personalized avatars of the students. This mobile app is available on Google Play and the Apple store. 

UME produced and created the virtual worlds for the Amazon series, FATHEAD. We created the main 3D world of a Junkyard Paradise junkyard where the story takes place.. UME presented FATHEAD at the Hollywood Production Association, the leading symposium for industry leaders.

Alternative tourism in Greece and worldwide is a big trend and it is estimated that over 35% of travelers want to do some alternative activity.
But while alternative tourism is growing rapidly, the Greek tourism industry is not organized to follow this growth:

• Greek and foreign travelers do not have the proper means to search, find and book whatever activity they are looking for.
• Activity providers have high promotional costs and a limited digital presence.
• Travel agencies abroad have a small range of activities that they offer to their customers.
• Hotels waste a lot of time offering activities to their customers with little or no profit.","Unlimited adrenaline is coming to solve these problems, with the first marketplace of alternative activities in Greece, and the right tools for every hotelier and travel agent.
We also provide tools to help our partners manage their businesses, and automate their processes, thus digitalizing the travel industry. 
Our goal is to interconnect more than 2,000 businesses in this field, thus creating the largest database with activities in Greece. This way we have 3 important benefits:

• Travelers can now discover all the activities in the area and book quickly and safely.
• Activity providers can manage and promote their services, having their own management system, to which we are increasing features and functions.
• Through our SaaS affiliate program, travel agencies, and hotels can offer activities to their customers without spending work hours and create a new revenue stream for their business.
• Overall, we want to promote Greece as a hotspot for alternative tourism, increasing net spending, new categories of travelers, and extending the tourism seasons.
","The total market is travelers in Greece, locals, and foreigners, which was calculated at 31M people. Based on research about alternative tourism, 40% of Travelers choose to participate in an alternative activity. To conclude, our Target Market can be estimated at approximately 12M people. Alternative tourism has experienced vast growth over the past years worldwide and is projected to triple in size by 2027 reaching 1.1B euros in Greece and 700B worldwide. In addition, our SaaS affiliate program has a Target Market of over 10K hotels and 40K accommodation properties.

The competition, of course, exists in the field of activities from large platforms abroad. Still, we have much greater penetration in the Greek market with a greater variety of activities and partnerships.
On the other hand, we offer all the functions that the big platforms have, but with more competitive prices for our customers and partners. Moreover, we are not another impersonal platform. Our philosophy is to have meaningful communication with our customers, and personalized and quality services. We know the field of alternative tourism in Greece, we have met closely with most of our partners and through our frequent communication, we have direct feedback from the market.","Although the last 2 years have not favored the tourism industry at all, so far we have managed to have over 400+ partnerships with activity providers throughout Greece and in total more than 2K activities. A key figure that shows our growth as well, is that we have increased our revenues 5 times from 2020 to 2021.
Despite Covid, we have had over 1000 bookings and we have served over 3000 customers to date, while we have managed to have over 300k unique users and 650Κ views on our page in the last 18 months. 
In addition, after starting an affiliate program with hotels and accommodation properties, we managed to have over 70 partnerships in just 2 months.

","Our product is a Business application aimed for tourism professionals (tour activity providers), allowing them to promote their products, chat with potential customers, see communication history, do marketing campaigns and get helpful insights from the market. Tourism professionals can simply register on the application, add their products and start building strong relationships with their customers.

Our application is mobile-friendly and intuitive, supporting professionals every minute of the day. "," Upiria is focusing on decentralization of the travel experience market as opposed to the competitors who are predominantly focusing on the big OTAs. Those big OTA have the monopoly and the power to raise the commission fees quite high and make it impossible for SMEs (tour and activity providers to sustain their business). Sometimes the commission goes up to 25%-30% and if you add the tax those businesses have to pay, its simply not sustainable. This approach heavily contributes to the black market  issue which impacts the Greek and other economies relying on the travel industry.

Our philosophy is to decentralize this approach and connect tour and activity providers to hotels, companies (connection to HR), municipalities, travel associations etc. Basically, allowing them to sell their products to end customers via various channels. This approach allows us to offer more traffic to the business and still keep the commission to 10%. Especially after the pandemic business models that focus on decentralization (hence the big push on Web3.0) are the ones that will take over due to the fact they exist to create a sustainable ecosystem with the right power balance between stakeholders.","At Upiria we believe that you can reach your full potential only when you do the things you absolutely love.

After finding a home tenants are usually required to move their furniture and house equipment and set up services. This is a process a few would be happy to have more than a few times on a lifetime. 
So, what about people wanting to work from anywhere and create experiences on different cities of the world? Hotels cannot be a choice and most serviced apartments complexes found in big cities are far away from what is considered a true local experience. UPSTREET provides a seamless living experience to every guest from day one. Residencies located on neighborhoods and buildings that locals live are prepared with care for guests ready to move in. Guests can choose their next home through high detailed photos and videos before booking, book a home from their pc or smartphone in a few clicks, and get every info they need from our Guest experience web app. A process that used to take weeks, offered in a few clicks.","Business processes are utilizing technology in every aspect of the product journey. From booking and communication to maintenance and property acquisition, all business operations are optimized through technology with customized apps. Daily processes that would normally need human interaction are completed automatically allowing employees to focus where they are needed the most. 

Business optimization through technology dramatically decreases costs and enhances customer satisfaction. Offering a home as a service is more of providing an experience and less than selling a product. The core product principal is to provide a standardized quality and a unique experience at the same time. For that reason, we developed extended quality standards and then we apply them to create unique spaces every time. Our guests can feel the home like experience when at the same time receive the same quality of service. This process allows us to replicate and scale on multiple locations and units.

To ensure the sustainability of the core idea we are investing a lot in the design process, already in the company’s DNA since our founders have an engineering background of more than 15 years. Among the very few on the market with property expertise.","2017 - Year of incorporation company receives 350K euro seed investment.

It also creates a level playing field enabling vehicles of different performance to be compared against each other. Our purpose-built device “Symmetry”, records the dynamic data of the vehicle for each driving session. Using GSM Technology, “Symmetry” uploads the data to the VPR server, where our highly intelligent, patent-pending algorithm can process it.
","We provide a platform which allows drivers of different vehicles and skill sets, to measure their capabilities in a controlled environment and eventually become better drivers. Through the data collected by our device, our algorithm can process, monitor and evaluate not only the vehicle's capabilities but also the driver’s skills and efficiency. Furthermore, having a common denominator, we are providing a fair platform through which the individual talent can be measured and awarded, without having budget and resources affecting any results we provide. 

Our service can add tremendous value to various markets such as: motorsports, automotive leisure activities, driving schools, driver safety programs, insurance sector, R&D in the automotive industry (tire/chassis/suspension companies). Our vision is not only to help the public embrace the joy of driving as a leisure activity in a controlled environment, but also to reduce human casualties due to reckless driving on public road networks. 
","Α large number of people loves motorsports and enjoys spirited driving however the budgets related to motorsports are setting a barrier for them. On the other hand, there is a misconception that even for simple track days there is a big cost involved in order to participate. Hence people decline the opportunity before even exploring it. We wanted to bring people to the safety of the racetrack instead of exploring their talents on the public roads. 

The automotive industry has a value of 80 billion USD and will grow to just under nine trillion U.S. dollars by 2030. Motorsports is a market which will surpass 8,55 billion USDs until 2025 growing at a rate of 10% annually. Our service can be used in sub-markets such as: motorsports (cars, karts, bikes), race circuit venues, automotive leisure activities (track days), driving schools, driver safety programs, R&D in the automotive industry (tire/chassis/suspension companies), insurance companies, event organisers and many more. 
","Initially, our company slowly entered the motorsports market by providing our service to track day organisers in Greece, France, Germany and Belgium. At the same time, we provided subscription packages to professional racing teams for their training and racing applications.
We also turned our focus to the GoKart market which seemed to be in need of such a product for a very long time. VPR supported professional but also amateur teams with the tools they needed in order to reach their goals in a faster, more cost efficient but also sustainable way. Over the course of a few weeks, our company brought in more than 20 new clients, some of them immediately agreeing on annual subscriptions. Below we’re listing some of the most important milestones:

- Patent Pending Algorithm
- Designing and manufacturing our own device
- Launching our cloud platform providing unique user friendly data
- Partnering with our first thrilled clients in Europe
- Receiving exposure in 168 countries through TV magazines
","We are a compact team based in Greece and the one common thing between all of us is the love for motorsports and data analytics. For the past 15+ years we have all participated in motorsports activities in one way or the other, either through actual circuit and hill climb competitions, to time attack events or regular track days.

We start our focus on the construction industry, one of the world's largest but also most inefficient industries. There are estimates that nearly 20% of every construction project is reworked due to a low degree of accuracy and precision between the initial drawings and the actual building. The problem of rework is so widespread that the industry operates on an average 1~2% margin. The root of this problem stems from the fact that the construction industry is still relying on tools and processes developed decades ago to tackle the problem of precision.

Particularly, the stakeholders of the AEC sector (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) need to sustain physical access to project sites, in order to acquire the as-built information of the building asset during the pre-installation and post-installation phases, as part of a digitalised supply chain process. The main indoor areas that require high precision information, include indoor application systems such as heat, ventilation, air-conditioning and elevators systems.","Precision construction offers added value to contractors providing building assets. A niche market of such assets is referring to indoor systems, a key vertical market of the construction industry. The building asset's assessment is a thorough, lengthy and risky process, disconnected from the construction progress, requiring contractors to physically visit each area to survey dimensions, structural deviations and anomalies, to ensure the provision of a system compliant with the building’s physical specifications. 

The solution introduces a unified system consisting of an Autonomous unmanned aerial system (UAS), a cloud-based service and a set of custom developed AI algorithms to digitalize hard-to-reach building assets by traversing confined spaces not easily reachable by humans for collecting, analyzing, and delivering structural data in a ready-to-use format.

The solution allows remote access to spatial info, while the collected data are analysed to the cloud via a 4G/5G networks, generating the asset's 'as-built' building information model (BIM).","The company fills the digital gap of the value chain between the main building contractor, installation/maintenance service providers and equipment manufacturers, offering productivity gains through autonomous assessment, safer operations, and compliant communication amongst stakeholders. 

Growth potential lies in (1) cutting-edge innovation and (2) scalable business model. The patent-pending solution of the autonomous industry-focused indoor operation embeds perception, cognition, safe and environment-aware navigation, as well as an integrated approach of 5G communication capabilities and cloud-based interoperability. The scalable business model establishes a digital ecosystem in the form of a marketplace, where the 'as-built' attributes of building assets utilised as profit-driving elements, matching the interests of key stakeholders around the building asset.","VERTLINER has built solid traction on its business proposition, by achieving the following strategic milestones:
- qualified to the Finals of the ""MIT Enterprise Forum Greece"" innovation competition.
- awarded the 'Seal of Excellence' by the European Commission.

It was established in 2016 when George Varvarelis and Dimitris Evangelopoulos, frustrated with the agriculture process being stuck with the same inefficient system since ages, decided to provide a solution for fast and easy uptake of the most modern farming techniques. Augmenta’s vision is to be the enabler for sustainable and productive agriculture through the wide uptake of precision methods among all farmers. It adopted the mission of automating and precisely measuring the most financially effective farm operations, like the use of nutrients and chemicals, through real-time, multispectral computer vision. Augmenta's goal is to increase the efficiency of every hectare of land, ultimately augmenting the bottom-line of the average farmer. The Company's success was recognized by Forbes, which listed the founders among the 30 under 30 List for Greece in 2019.","Augmenta's System is an all-in-one plug & play system that is mounted to the front of a tractor. As the tractor operates in the field, the software uses AI/ML models to analyse the captured images, determine the status of each inch of crop and regulate inputs. The scanning system also communicates with the sprayer/spreader using the ISOBUS protocol to maintain a constant flow of information for variable rate applications. The system maximises yield, quality and reduces crop inputs. The AI/ML software continuously improves itself using data collected before, during, and after crop treatments are deployed. This makes it a resilient and long-lasting investment for farmers. The system has been developed initially for 15 crops: Barley; Cotton; Corn; Rapeseed/Canola; Rice; Sorghum; Sugar cane; Soybean; Wheat, Grapes, Tomatoes, Potatoes, Onions, Leafy greens, and Sunflowers.","The Augmenta System has a great scale-up potential due to:
1 ) Technical features. Its hardware is built using off- the shelf NIR and 4k range cameras (Sony and Nvidia). The company will have a small in-house assembly line that can be easily outsourced to contract manufacturers around the world, enabling quick and non-capital intensive industrialization. The built-in AI/ML-driven software and cloud analytics, are highly scalable and able to improve themselves using sophisticated AI algorithms, meaning that the more the innovation is adopted by farmers, in Europe and internationally, the better its performance improvement will be. The technology is scalable since it improves several tasks in crop input, crop types, and increased predictive capability for crop management, which will be expanded in the future for weed and plant disease control.
2) Regulatory requirements: Augmenta has already considered the regulations needed to achieve market authorisation. The company is in the process of filing for the CE mark and will be able to timely comply with the regulatory requirements.
3) Commercialisation strategy and business model: Augmenta will target large farms and cooperatives as go-to-market customers, starting from 2023 in the EU and from 2024 worldwide. Augmenta will sell the system through big international distributors that already have a strong presence in the market and a solid network of customers supporting quick market expansion.","In pilot testing/evaluation customers, our system improved yield by 11% and crop quality by 20%, and decreased chemical usage by up to 40%, resulting in a net gain of an average of €200 per ha per season. Applied across the EUs 173M ha of arable land, this would bring EU farmers an additional €34.6B revenue. Augmenta's system supports sustainable farming, making it economically effective for the farmers, reducing the need for institutional economic help. It also offers the possibility of directly measuring inputs to the fields, allowing for accurate monitoring of the agricultural practices.
Currently, the Augmenta System has been deployed 73 times across 17 different countries and our customers have used the system in more than 36.000 acres.","Augmenta's team currently comprises 46 members, all with high-level academic backgrounds with specialisations (M.Sc or PhD in Engineering, Robotic, Agriculture, Maths, and Business). The team includes software and hardware engineers, agronomy, operation and communication experts. Altogether, the team brings tens of years of commercial experience and relevant technical expertise, spanning from agriculture, business, algorithm and software development, and the optimization of manufacturing processes. Augmenta plans to further expand its team by hiring a CFO, additional software developers, hardware engineers, and sales managers to finalize product development and sustain and coordinate the consequent business expansion.","Developing an Agritech solution is a quite complex endeavor. Our team includes Software and Hardware Engineers, Agronomists, ML/AI, and Computer Vision Scientists, as well as Sales, Marketing, HR, Admin, and Operations managers. Our strongest asset nevertheless, is that many of us are also farmers, including the two co-founders. In order to achieve our goals, the product and business teams need to grow to 100 employees in the coming two years.

We can expand around the globe as our product is used as a SaaS so any retailer can use it. Currently we are in contact with big retail stores in Saudi Arabia and we are trying to expand to that region too. We don't believe that there is a barrier which can stop our potential growth.

This why they invest heavily on loyalty schemes that attract customers and reward them . The problem is that not all customers sing in and most of those that sign in , rarely use it. So they do not meet their main objective for revenue generation  as well as  this leads to several issues  related to the costs of their loyalty schemes like how to keep the operating / redeem costs low and how to unleash money from the liabilities while increasing members satisfaction. 

On the other side, a typical consumer joins several loyalty schemes , collects points , but forgets to use them or considers the perks offered by the loyalty scheme issuer, not attractive 

As a result a huge investment with limited results

","Our solution allows users to use free money that that already have in their hands but can't use them . At the same time , brings new customers and more transactions to the companies that operate loyalty schemes and are members of the wadata network

The product is a loyalty digital wallet where consumers connect all their loyalty cards and have several alternatives on hot to use their loyalty points . This flexibility is based on points conversion functionality that the wadata wallet offers and allows users to convert their points to a digital coin, called wadata coin. The user can use this coin either to activate vouchers that allows special discounts or prices to the network , or to use it directly as an alternative means of payment . Last but not least users can use it to make donation in a series of NGOs that are part of wadata network 


","The originality of this idea is that the loyalty points are stored in a single digital wallet and these points can be exchanged and used as a digital currency . To do so we have implemented a calculations mechanism for the conversion that takes in consideration both business parameters as well as specific characteristics of the loyalty schemes  

Regarding scalability , the product can be initiated in more countries easily , since it also allows points conversion between schemes that are active in different countries . The onboarding process is relatively simple and doesn't need any special change to the IT infrastructure of the client   
","Wadata has early traction so far. 20 SMEs are on board as well as 4 NGOs 

","We truly believe that only deep knowledge of an industry can help someone to identify a problem or a gap as well as to create ideas on how to solve this . Both of us have extensive experience in the customer loyalty and customer engagement  solutions industry combined with a strong business and marketing background

Fast forward to the present, wappier is now a team of 90, investing with 2/3 of the company in data science and engineering to make our mission thrive.
Our mission: Transforming the way app developers and marketers maximize consumer revenue by using powerful AI that goes beyond typical marketing automation.

Whether there is a game, or an e-commerce app, publishers need to be able to understand who their users are. Doing this for millions of users in a real-time and personalized way is complex. Based on these deep insights, wappier’s Intelligent Revenue Management Platform helps app and game developers engage deeper with their users and incentivize their behavior towards their KPIs.

Based on game ecosystem reports, this number is expected to double within the next years, so possibilities for growth appear to be endless. Also new products are in the pipeline which target not only to game studios but also other verticals such as consulting companies, e-commerce and retail. Barrier to the above growth seems to be the attraction of competent personnel from the domestic market and especially to engineering and computer science related positions. Should we able to attract and hire the required personnel, this will boost the progress of the platform development as well as the execution of the signed contracts which will bring value to our clients and help us grow further.","wappier, through customer growth resulting in revenue increase and management monitoring of expenditure and cash flows, has managed to perform on positive cash flow basis.

Our platform creates the complete itinerary for your vacation with 1 click. Customize it exactly as you want, intuitively and delightfully, in real-time.

World-class team, immense market, and a 10x product with already extraordinary stickiness.","Travel planning today is fragmented and too manual. You have to compile your itinerary from scratch and juggle accommodation and transportation on your own, going back & forth across various sites. To organize a trip, esp. if you’re visiting more than just 1 city, requires days of effort - which if you can’t dedicate, you can go to a travel agency - And get a cookie-cutter itinerary designed for the lowest common denominator and get crammed into a large group. Or if you want something bespoke, pay a hefty amount, with little transparency and back & forth for every option you might want to consider.

We believe that software can solve all these issues. We believe it’s possible to have everything that is great with independent travel, delivered faster, cheaper and better than by a travel agency.

This is WeAreTravelers. The ideal Travel Agent, in A.I.

Our platform generates the complete itinerary for your vacation with 1 click - Sights & experiences, food & nightlife, accommodation & transportation. 

Customize everything exactly as you wish, uniquely intuitively, on the spot. 

To achieve this, we have implemented a combination of cutting-edge research and technologies (see below) and have crafted a fully tailored UI, which our users love.","Our offering is radically different from what the established players in Travel are doing. They do specific components only (e.g. hotels) and even those with more than 1, have no tight integration between them. In our solution, everything is always in sync. E.g. if you select to travel from Mykonos to Santorini 1 day later, you see, upon click, the updated ferry/plane tickets for this transfer and your accommodation and experiences in both destinations appropriately adjusted.

Additionally, by them you have to manually put together your itinerary bit by bit. We generate it algorithmically for you, instantly.

In order to achieve this, we are utilizing cutting-edge research and technologies:
* To create your itinerary fully dynamically, we are solving one of the hardest computer science problems, the “travelling salesman problem”.
* The Customization Engine uses Machine Learning.
* Availability, prices and the main bulk of the info are retrieved via Integrations.

Our solution scales particularly well: All we do is the cherry-picking of the places (sights/venues/etc) we want on our platform and then the algorithm synthesizes the itineraries for the requested destinations. The place’s info comes from the integrations, so adding new places, and hence destinations, is mostly a decision of switching them on.

Also our model does not require great depth of places. If the user can browse among the best ~30 choices for their typology per place-type, they are more than covered","Our ads have been profitable, even while basic functionality was missing.

And users love our product:
* >30-minute sessions per return user
* >3 itineraries per user
* >18 itinerary adjustments per user.

The first step in achieving our proposed revolution is to build the shared physical infrastructure and associated technologies required to empower talented cooks (food product creators) to eschew the hurdles required to open and operate a traditional business (restaurant, retail or otherwise) and enable them to become freelance chef-entrepreneurs by selling products on our digital platform.  The solution, in this case, is the construction of a large-scale, shared production kitchen facility, the development of a digital marketplace (app) and the additional provision of all required services necessary to operate both (fundraising, legal, marketing, analytics, etc.).  From the initial product (ready to eat meals/items prepared by individual chef micro-brands and delivered on-demand via electric vehicle) WeCook envisions an expanding product line to include proprietary grocery and retail food items, meal kits, raw ingredients and more.","WeCook provides a two-way solution including the physical and digital infrastructure to launch and run a microbusiness.  

The physical infrastructure is a collaborative production kitchen complete with state of the art equipment, multiple cooking stations, two onsite chefs for education and oversight, an onsite grocery for purchasing ingredients, and everything that a chef requires to produce a food product for sale and delivery.  

The digital infrastructure is an app that functions as an online marketplace for chefs not only to sell and distribute their product, but also to develop and create a brand and ongoing customer following.  For the consumer, the app is a content rich and immersive experience that goes beyond food ordering, payments and delivery, and offers the conscious eater a host of interactivity and services including nutrition and meal planning, cooking demonstrations and recipes, and internal social networks connecting eaters and food-producers to replace that which has been lost via existing convenience apps.

We additionally provide services to manage and optimize these businesses, such as data analysis, cost analysis, budgeting, and so on, allowing us to curate locally-produced, home style, sustainable food for delivery on demand and to deliver the daily food demands of conscious eaters with the same convenience as competitors. ","Relative to other food convenience technologies, our model allows us to own and curate not only the logistics of meals but also their production while enabling chefs to become chef-entrepreneurs with minimal cost. In effect, the participating creators collaborate to produce a full-fledged menu made up only of the items each one considers uncompromisingly their best product.

Battery and energy storage solutions are significant factor permitting the use of the energy produced from RW sources at the time when the consumer requires. They are also improve the quality of the produced energy improving the frequency and the voltage regulation. 
Our company develops standard and tailor made energy storage solutions for RW energy producers who wish to store part of their  production for use when their production is limited or zero. It targets residential and commercial users providing cost efficiency and quite lower costs than the energy cost from the grid. The innovated product is based on the long experience in the field and provide one of the lowest costs per KWh in the market with 20 years life expectancy.
At the same time the company develops a charging process to extend the lifecycle of used batteries from automotive hybrids. This process extends the lifecycle of batteries at the end of their nominal life for 2 more years and plus.   
","Our company is developing standard energy storage solutions from 5KWh up to 1MWh designed for lower possible cost per KWh. Our design will offer systems with quite lower cost than the grid cost with life expectancy of 20 years relavent with the lifetime of PV or other RW power systems.
In parallel, we are developing solution for fast and reliable service to the battery systems for hybrid cars extending their life expectancy using special processes for the recalibration of the battery systems. This is in full conformity with the environmental directions for second life and longer possible service of Li-ion batteries. 
The energy storage systems provides big economies of scale to the energy savings (all produced energy is used and if not used, it is moving to the public network), optimum use and performance of the materials with corresponding pollution reduction and improved environmental footprint. 
Especially the energy storage systems our company develops is 99,9% recyclable at the end of their life in contrary with the products of many other competitors who their products are not recyclable.
","Τhe company develops energy storage systems with life expectancy of 20 years and 5.200 cycle life at 70% depth of discharge with cost under 0.10 cents per KWh, which is among the lowest costs of energy production and the battery energy systems. This is an improvement of VRLA batteries in association with charging curves to protect the system and permits longer life under stable performance. 
The main difference with competitors is the lower cost per KWh and the easy and wide available recyclability of the system. 
As regards the life extension for the hybrid car batteries, we are developing techniques for battery life prolongation and use of end life batteries to new applications. This is mainly based on battery regeneration adopting to the NiMH and Li-ion technologies used to hybrids with own developed charging processes. 
Regarding the energy storage systems there is a potential for minimum 25% growth for residential market in years 2021 – 2022 and higher than 35% for the years after due to the significant support to the fossil fuels use reduction for enviremental reasons and the governmental support to the green energy and use of RW. 
Regarding the battery life extension program it is planning an annual growth of minimum 35% at the next 5 years and then higher to 50-55% per year. The figures are based on the hybrid cars outspread of the last years. By 2030, global market size for end life hybrid vehicles is expected to hit over 275GWh per year.","-      Strategic alliance with company Sebang Global Battery Ltd for the development of tailor made solutions for clients of automotive batteries and distribution on different channels

The problem is that the existing UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles-Drones, etc) are designed either as Helicopters or Airplanes.
In helicopter design (-copters) they benefit from vertical take off capabilities but the duration and range of flight is limited.
In airplane design (-planes) they benefit from high speed and long range-duration, but cannot be launched from confined areas or hover where is needed.
The opportunity is to create a machine that benefits from both designs.
Also sustainable management of water in agriculture is critical to increase agricultural production, ensure water can be shared with other users and maintain the environmental and social benefits of water systems. There is a need to improve the economic efficiency and environmental effectiveness of policies that seek to improve water resource use efficiency and reduce water pollution from agricultural systems.
To have better watering management, soil moisture and temperature sensors are putting at soil. This has many disadvantages mainly at big, cultivated fields. For instance, to have accurate readings from the total field you must have many sensors spread into the field. That makes difficult to do any future cultivation work with tractor as in most cases either you must take out the sensors from soil and after the work done to replace that at their position.
","Our R&D department has designed and Developed a UAV platform (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) with vertical take off capability (helicopter capability), but at the same time is converted to an Airplane and then back as a helicopter (any time this is needed to be done).
So this machine incorporates the advantages of the both ""worlds"" (helicopter & airplane)
Helicopter vertical take off & Hover (especially in confined areas)
Airplane flight (high speed, economy, advanced duration of flight and range of flight)
A unique multi-role Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System (UAV) with special design, having specific sensors for soil moisture and temperature as well as mounted high-resolution camera for inspection fulfill the requirements for solution to the problems mentioned above.
SLUMAS is a hybrid fully autonomous mobile unit. Its ability to execute fully autonomous operations (deployment, operational checks, flight mission, redeployment, battery charging, maintenance – storage operations, remote health self-monitoring) combined with the embedded hybrid technology & the smart payload configuration.
Due to its characteristics, it can easily take off from a limited needed area of 2 m2 and can cover a large flying area having an autonomy of 7 hours and its Cruise Speed can reach 180 km/h. Also, the flying plan can be preprogramed at specific intervals. For example, every six hours flight above the cultivated fields to get the required data for better water management.

We are solving for a better and healthier life where one gets to make the best of their body, whether they are an elite athlete, or just an urban dweller. 

We have based our solution called PNOĒ  (“Πνοή”) on solid evidence known in the scientific community for a long time. In fact, for 100+ years, breath analysis (AKA metabolic testing, VO2max) has been the gold standard in longevity assessment, nutrition prescription, and evaluation of most critical organs (i.e., heart, lungs, cells). 

Until recently, breath analysis was only available in sophisticated clinics. Through our solution, any doctor, gym, or wellness-related business can provide the most advanced nutrition and health optimization program possible without any special training.

in all developed countries in the world. Based on the above, a business opportunity is formulating that
addresses both end-user and energy station.
This business venture is all about bridging drivers with energy/fuel stations by establish a win-win
relationship for all parties, the drivers, the partners and us. The notion is that with a triangular business
model, we are selling in both parties what the need to enhance the driving experience, make their life
easier, get lower prices for fuel-products and on the other hand make partners business profitable.
Through an intelligent central system this Marketplace for Energy/Fuel Station, could be applied to a wide
range of countries and its target audience. Therefore, a different strategy should be employed to address
each type / segment of energy stations: from an independent station to a chain.
Our competition spans into two directions that has been located and analyze below
mainly on activities that target the drivers, with various platform offering applications and businesses that
surround the energy stations, by offering discount schemes, loyalty, etc.
In the future, this notion allows to unlock other possibilities and participate to other vehicle related
business sections.","Energy market, as well as the facts makes us anticipate that this market will continue to grow incorporating new forms of energy sources, vehicles,
and business opportunities.
The energy market besides its size, introduces offering diversity when addressing retail customers in terms
of products, pricing, side-products, and services. Observing any energy delivery station, i.e. fuel/petrol
stations, customers are offered
> fuel/energy of some form, i.e. petrol, diesel, gas, electricity
> market products, ranging from basic car accessories to anything you may find in a supermarket
plus, fresh products
> services, that may include car-washing, rest areas, snack-bars, etc. just to name a few
These markets - energy stations, have based their business around re-fueling vehicles, while selling other
types of products and services to
> increase their revenue
> differentiate their offering from their competitors
> act as a one-stop-shop, for a range of products and services
Many energy stations are already addressing the above, by delivering various flavours of offerings and
mixtures of the above. Chains try to unify their offering throughout their branches, or in many cases they
attempt to tailor based on locality, season, customer base, etc. Further, they try to focus on services that
require a more personal and humane touch; factor that affects sales and customer loyalty significantly","we see a business opportunity formulating that addresses both end-user and energy
station:
End-users need to find services tailored to what they are looking for, and energy stations trying to expand
their business. This business venture is all about bridging end-users with energy stations that are willing
to share a small portion of their margin in exchange to get promoted and improving visibility, reputation
and above all increase in profit. To achieve this, information, promotions, offers, and service suitability
based on driver preferences can only delivered to them through a mobile phone application.
This business, which we like to address as “Yiufi”, will require the introduction of a new software platform,
the Yiufi Platform, that will act as the primary tool for achieving all the above. This business / initiative to
work and become successful requires that
o energy station can see value and potential by joining as customers
o drivers, or end-users also get value by enjoying
o tailored promotions and offers, based on their profile, behavior, and preferences
o lower prices when purchasing re-fueling, purchasing goods and services, pre-order fuels
o the calculated choice based on energy station prices, rating, range of services and service
speed","The presented study takes into consideration both markets, the Greek and UK. Research has been
performed in both countries, identifying the need for a product / platform with the capabilities described
previously.
Based on our input, as well as better knowledge of the market, it has been decided to deploy his solution
Greece first, and gradually to other countries. The Greek market comprises over 5500 petrol stations and
a few hundreds of charging points that increase rapidly.

proposal. Besides the founding members, yiufi has several associate members that are part of the team and help in the technical implementation of the project.

of experience on delivering IT projects, acting as a digital solution architect. Professionally is has worked for over 15 years in the industry, mostly with cutting edge projects and
technologies.
","This project requires a huge budget in a time line that we believe to be sustainable and profitable. An organization with a lot of moving parts is seeking not only the funding but the partners as well to support it. Our business is model is based on collaborations and partnerships 
Splitting the project in phase we can manage to control our expenses and the profit accordingly. The project will move step by step and our aim is to create the network with a minimum potentiality to seek funding.  
We offer and share stokes from our business in order to sky rocket this vision. Partners will share from their side collaboration or funds to be a part of this vision.

Such linear operations result in billions of dollars of value wasted in raw materials and energy, not sufficient utilisation of assets, and disposal costs. Linear businesses have higher risk of default on debt, and less attractiveness for investment. Sustainable development and, in particular, circular management of assets reduce this risk, increase attractiveness for further investments and contribute to a regenerative ecosystem where businesses, people and the environment can thrive. To this end, ZELUS aims to provide consulting services and deliver digital tools to help organisations better understand their impact, design their circular strategy and manage their operations and their associated resources in a sustainable, circular way.","We deliver hands-on training sessions to assist stakeholders in understanding risks and sketching a solid path to capitalise on arising opportunities. We, also, assess organisations’ circular capabilities, by identifying the gaps and the potential within their business and value chain for circular service and product design, operations, and business models. Our offering is complemented with the digital bank of goods (products and components), a smart visualisation toolkit that enables monitoring and analysis of the organisations’ sustainability practices and drives continuous awareness within business and across value chains, regarding goods stocks and their properties, throughout their lifecycle. This can be further used towards more circular design and better supply chain management, through AI-enabled recommendations on the current use of each item, and their potential reuse, repurposing and recycling options.","Our key innovation lies in our focus on a system-thinking approach for transitioning to a circular economy. Building on top of our experience in cybersecurity and big data visualisations, we are developing a digital tool that enables secure data exchange (a really important element in sectors where operation insights are key to their market differentiation) and provides a user-friendly interface so that any stakeholder can make informed decisions, either being an IT expert or not. To the best of our knowledge, currently, our competitors usually focus on the assessment of products’ circularity or sustainability or extending their lifecycle (reselling/renting/swapping/etc) or managing them as waste (recycling facilities). Our solution aggregates these services and provides quantitative information and motivation from one hand to businesses to produce higher quality and more circular products and from the other hand to consumers to reward those businesses and benefit accordingly. A key competitive advantage is also the utilisation of AI to support decision-making across every step of the product lifecycle. Our vision is to eventually support the creation of ecosystems that will transform not only a single organisation, but entire value chains, in order to achieve a successful transition to a circular economy.","Since the launch of our sustainability offering (early 2022), our digital solutions have already stood out in multiple contexts. The EU-funded S4Fashion project, seeking for projects to pilot novel processes and create a product, service or business model with scale up potential for sustainable or circular fashion. selected ZELUS' Digital Bank of goods adjusted for the fashion industry and called Digital closet (brand name: VÒNG). The Digital closet was also selected in the initial phase of one more mentoring scheme called U-Solve focusing on solutions that enable circular economy and waste reduction in cities. Both programs focus a lot on consumers' behavioral change that drives demand for more sustainable and circular textile products.
We have also already started working on other services of the Digital Bank addressing the textile industry and another part of the industry's value chain namely the garment production. ROCTex is a service that enables textile producers to accelerate the adoption of technological innovation required in the sector, in order to increase their energy efficiency and reduce their footprint during the production process. This service enables data collection and digital connectivity of the product life cycle phases for building or enriching the digital product passport of each manufactured item. This initiative is supported by the EU-funded KYKLOS4.0 Open Call for innovative solutions that enable circular manufacturing.","The team consists of a multidisciplinary group of experts with complementary skills in the development of ZELUS business in the field of sustainability. Ms Aggeliki Piknada (MSc), co-founder, is responsible for delivering the organisational culture profile and the managing of content development and marketing tasks.  Ms Dora Kallipolitou (MSc) is the Product and Innovation Manager and exhibits many years of experience in design thinking approaches for business transformation towards sustainable development through circular economy. Dr Vasilis Tountopoulos is the company CTO, working as a system architect and in business development. Finally, Ms Stella Markopoulou (MSc) is the main  software developer for the digital tools of the solution.","Despite the discussion regarding the importance of the transition to a circular economy, it is a fact that a lot of businesses are not ready yet to embark this journey and often do not even know where to start from. Similarly consumers are confused by the abundance of information that often are not even accurate (greenwashing) and as a result don't know what to trust. A big part of our investment is going to be dedicated to make our tools trustworthy and transparent both through the technology used in their development but also through their co-creation with our key audiences. 
Therefore we target funding that will allow us to do exactly that: connect us with our audiences and provide us with the resources (estimated value: 350K) to create awareness among our audience members and co-create together solutions beneficial for all.",,,,,Bootstrapped,NA

This can be achieved by optimizing the water supply expenditure in existing crops and the reuse of low-quality waters. There are various solutions to guide farmers about irrigation, but most of them require installation of equipment in the field and/or digital skills from farmers. Many farmers in order to play safe and to reduce the transports to the fields, over-irrigate and do not distribute water properly over time according to crop needs. In cases of limited water availability, the farmers apply less water quantity than deficit irrigation and also not at the right time according to the critical stages of crop. ","Zen IrriWare provides a solution for optimized use of irrigation water, an important external input for many crops. The irrigation requirements are calculated as the difference between crop evapotranspiration and the effective rainfall as measured in real time from any type of local meteorological stations. It also utilizes weather forecast to cancel irrigation when significant rain is coming, reduce crop risks (plant damage, e.g. in cases of heat waves) and improve yield (quantity and quality). In cases of limited water availability (dry years), requirements are calculated only for the critical growth stages (application of deficit irrigation). The software uses simple ways (SMS or e-mail) to communicate irrigation advices to the farmers in cases of manual irrigation. It could use API for Interaction with Irrigation controllers or valves. So, using precision irrigation we have an optimization in irrigation application compared to the empirical irrigation carried out by the farmers. ","The system’s architecture includes the ability to process real time weather data from any commercial brand of meteorological station, which has the required sensors, for Evapotranspiration calculation and even combine data from different sources for calculations’ reliability maximization. It uses weather forecasts from Wunderground and it can interact with various irrigation controllers in real time with use of their API. In Greece there are about 800 meteorological station with open data and the ZEN AGRO PC has 12 of those. Each station can provide data for many farmers in near area. In Greece according farmers crop declaration in 2018, there are about 1.800.000 irrigated farms. The above make the software fully functional for all over Greece and any farmer is a potential user. Proper data availability will make the proposed application also suitable for other countries, thus permitting greater geographical deployment and customer base expansion for our system. ","Our moto is: irrigate like the pros at a cost similar to that of an amateur irrigation programmer. The software can be used both by individual farmers and groups of farmers. Priority is farmer groups (our software is already used by six groups of farmers in more than 3500 farms). The target group is not only young people who are users of ICT and thus they will exploit easier all the specifications offered by this software, but also, farmers without digital skills who can easily use the software advices by the SMS function. The company communicate the software functions by participating in exhibitions (already in AGROTICA 2020), with advertisements on Social Media, with offer for a free testing period, with communication by phone or e-mail with farmers advisors, etc. The software interface will be bilingual and the Company web page has already an English version. Since the software uses methods proposed by FAO and international literature as well as data from different brands of commercial sensors and platforms it supports all kinds of crops and can be used globally. The software is already tested with data from meteorological stations outside of Greece. Members or collaborators of the company have great experience as irrigation advisors in foreign countries (China, Pakistan, Egypt..). We will try to extend the coverage step by step in more countries by spending a part of the turnover for advertising there.

The same assessment is running now for Publicis Groupe and till now the results are very promising. ,"Eirmos planning for 2022 is to have 3 new customers from the Belgian market and another 2 from the Greek market. According to a long-term goal for the decade we travel across, Eirmos aims to dominate the Greek market and expand to another 4 markets besides Belgian. The advanced features that Adacs offers for the demanding domain of advertising, makes us feel very optimistic about the future.  A potential barrier for this planning could be  the complexity of each new market. The advertising domain is global, but from our experience each market could have its unique characteristics that could slow down the introduction process. Another potential barrier for Eirmos growth could be very fast and rapid advance of the digital advertising. New trends and new methods are introduced every day, so Adacs must continually evolve in order to follow the market.

As we call it the Trip Planning Paradox. They use multiple tools and services to solve it with a great failure. No one can provide an exact itinerary for the whole trip. The main reason is that multiple challenges can occur during the trip duration, from change in weather conditions to crowded coasts, to no berth availability in marinas. Imagine that 90% of users make late night calls to friends, 55% searching for images, 88% use blogs and other tools and 92% user more that 4 subscriptions to make the trip planning efficient. But they still fail. ","We gather all the sources that creating safety in a boaters trip. So we launch a mobile app for android and iOS providing all the perfect details and the tools for someone to explore the coastline with his own needs and gather all the information in a trip bucket. An explorer can hire a virtual navigator and let him create a safe trip for a day or more and all he has to do is to execute it and chat in a seamless way to achieve a stress-free and safe exploration around the coast. On the other hand, we are launching a web application with the same tools as the mobile app but with a dashboard for all the professionals that want to provide trips easily.","We elevate the recreational boating experience by changing the mindset to all those trying to create the perfect trip not by using multiple subscriptions but by using a simple platform providing the intelligence of a co-pilot. We expand the market size with a new service that lets any sea expert be a virtual navigator ready to be hired per day, upgrading the data and providing dynamic itineraries to all those who need help at sea. They create their own trips, a new channel of communication, and a way to express their love for the sea, supporting people with detailed itineraries and earn money and reputation.

Most technology platforms are killing tracking cookies and imposing cumbersome privacy labels.
This means that first-party data are becoming critical for mobile app publishers to understand their users. However, even mining first party data comes with a lot of privacy concerns from users, as the Whatsapp case demonstrates, and regulators (GDPR, CCPA).

Until now, it was impossible to combine personalization and privacy - but a new technology called Federated Learning is now here to change this.

We are the first to enable mobile marketers tailor experiences on an individual level, while guaranteeing privacy. This is a billion dollar market, just taking into consideration North America.
Our long-term vision is to build the infrastructure for private machine learning across the billions of edge devices, which will reshape the way the world extracts knowledge.
","Lerna is building a novel solution that helps app publishers personalize their offering. The solution comprises two components: a mobile library and a cloud-based service.

We categorize our customers’ users based on their context and optimal engagement timing. Subsequently, we automate relevant actions, e.g. our cloud service exposes APIs and Webhooks that send push notifications with optimal content at the most relevant moment. We can offer more accurate predictions, as the amount of data available on the device is richer than what is used by vendors currently. In comparison to other solutions, we can offer more accurate predictions, as the amount of data available on the device is richer than that is used by vendors currently. By tapping into the sensor data as an additional  source, we can infer the user’s context.

The Lerna product is built on four pillars:
1.tIt unlocks out-of-the box mining of data directly on mobile devices
2.tIt increases the accuracy of this predictive learning, as its device libraries tap into an unprecedentedly rich dataset that never leaves the devices 
3.tIt builds the world’s most efficient privacy and security layer on top of mobile federated learning
4.tIt is simple for developers to integrate Lerna as a black-box without any knowledge of AI, privacy or federated learning","For Federated Learning to be truly privacy-preserving, there is a layer of privacy and security tools that need to be stacked up on top of the underlying learning infrastructure. However, in today’s FL frameworks, this privacy and security layer acts as a bottleneck and does not scale smoothly. We solve this by introducing a private trusted 3rd party, which ensures that we can achieve:
●t50x faster FL than current setups
●tHigher accuracy via private transfer learning
For this purpose we use cutting-edge technologies, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation and Differential Privacy.


There are massive growth opportunities in extending our solution. We are planning to turn Lerna into the underlying platform and stamp of approval for private Machine Learning across the billions of edge devices in the world.
This goes far beyond mobile, and includes wearables, driverless cars and manufacturing IoT.
","We have already built our MVP, enabling Android developers optimize the timing of their campaign outreach.
We have closed our pre-seed round, with participation from some of the best institutional investors in Greece. ","Our team possesses a deep domain expertise to solve the problem.
1.tUnderstanding of the privacy market: The two co-founders previously founded a startup automating compliance and de-identification for data mining. 
2.tInvolvement in open source communities: we have both contributed to working groups in the most successful open source community for federated learning. 
3.tExpertise in ML products and private data mining: Georgios Depastas has led ML products at Barclays, where he served as the Head of the Real-time Big Data Analytics portfolio.  Georgios Kellaris  is an expert in data privacy and secure data mining; he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the domain jointly at Harvard and Boston University.

The company, listening to the demands of the time which favor the turn to telemedicine as never before, decided to invest in it both in the field of medical devices of telemedicine Artificial Intelligence, and in the field of telemedicine software with Artificial Intelligence.

The company found that the conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have created specific operational problems (and not only) in health / hospitality structures that need to be resolved quickly to make them viable and functional again.

There was a shortage of medical staff and at the same time a lack of available financial resources so that this gap could be filled immediately. It has also been observed that despite the rapid improvement of artificial intelligence in our daily lives in many areas, similar progress has not yet been made in telemedicine.

So we moved on to solving the problem of understaffing by developing remote diagnostic tools that use Artificial Intelligence.","We have created a platform and We use the bio signals that result from the IoT devices (internet of things) and after analyzing the generating data, together with the patient data and the opinion of the treating physician, a pattern emerges and with the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning can predict and analyze different types of diseases by comparing the pattern.
The platform has already been embraced with great interest by the University Hospital of Heraklion and the commander of the hospital authorized us to form a scientific team with the professors of neurosurgery, cardiology and neurology who are part of the development team.
The goal of the platform is after the completion to receive bio signals from any IoT device (internet of things) and to predict and analyze diseases depending on the data it receives and as the IoT devices evolve and produce more data, so the platform will evolve and will accept more data to analyze","The Kalchas Platform, will be saled gradually:

A. The Kalchas Platform will be sold to doctors and Health Units into Greece and Worldwide.
B. At large medical spaces (Hospitals, Clinics, Nursing Homes, Rehabilitation Centers)
C. In the domestic market of a telemedicine platform that can be used either in the public health system (eg: remote or understaffed health centers), or in the armed forces (eg: remote military units, warships at sea ), or in the wider private sector (eg: private hospitals, insurance companies)

As it is decribed into the attached document below, the incomes from Kalchas Sales will gain in a 5-year plan:

installations, and costs for technological equipment. The project has estimated time
6 months of development, but for another 4 months after the first issue it will be necessary to

concerns the first period of operation of the group, until the disbursement of funding by

As a result, all stakeholders in the domain cannot (a) quantify the extent of existing bee losses and their causes, (b) decide on pollination policies, (c) monitor and predict the quality and quantity of honey production.
The primary source of data lies on the beekeepers. However, it is practically impossible for them to record information on site due to their cumbersome uniform and gloves. So, they resort to memory, improvised markings and handwritten notes to record information, resulting in significant delays and inefficiencies. ","Our solution,  Beenotes™ platform comprises the following interrelated components:
A. Beehive inspector: a mobile application based on a robust voice user interface, based on the state of the art Google voice recognition tool and converting text to speech and speech to text.  It supports the efficient collection of beekeeping data on-site and it interacts with the existing database offering on site information from previous hive inspections. 
B. Beenotes™ database: collected data are seamlessly uploaded and synchronized to a cloud database. 
C. Apiary modeling engine: The core component. It implements a state-of-the-art computational beekeeping framework and is responsible for exploiting all collected data to inform hive-specific models for honey production.
D. Beekeeper’s interface: The beekeeper has access to all collected information and modeling results via powerful visualization options providing an insightful overview of all apiaries’ state and activities.","Beenotes platform is the voice guided, smart digital personal assistant for data collection and analysis that supports decision making for best beekeeping practices. It resolves the existing recording problem while it introduces a data driven approach to beekeeping. Thus, the anticipated learning curve is decreased and the beekeeper’s transformation to a skilled professional with a competitive edge is drastically accelerated.
Currently, there is no affordable solution in the market, to facilitate the automatic data recording straight from all the hives. Beekeeping actions depend mainly on the beekeeper’s experience and instinct producing poor results for the majority as fact reflected on the low productivity of the domain.
The primary source of Revenues will be generated by the current platform through subscriptions. In addition, when users reach a critical mass we will have the opportunity for additional revenues through the development of new products related to consulting services based on data analytics and the use of metadata.","Since May 2020 we have attracted 400 registered users with zero marketing costs. We are now concluding the first major update/pivot to our product and we have scheduled a marketing campaign starting in January 2021, to attract a minimum of 1500 users within a period of 30 days.

The products and services offered by 3DHUB are 3D printing and 3D scanning hardware and services, selling of 3D printing materials (filaments as well  resins, binders and powders) and 3D printing/3D scanning solutions (both hardware and software), plus 3D Design and support/training services. 3DHUB is also involved in R&D and in particular on the topic of using metallic powders recovered from recycled PCB’s to develop 3D printable filaments for use in FDM 3D printers. ","The Additive Manufacturing technologies we specialize in, can accelerate the RND progress of new products by shortening the iteration cycle, making faster proof of concept prototypes and test units of new devices within days instead of months. Also by using 3D printing technologies we can bypass the logistic problems by decentralized individual construction of parts without the need of time consuming shipping or need to stock. This became evident to the wider public during the first stages of the pandemic where 3DHUB was able to quickly produce and supply >35000 of 3D printed face shields to hospitals and the ministry of health in Greece. Our technologies have also great impact on health and dental sector due to the personalized nature of medical items & prosthetics.3DHUB is also involved in green R&D projects such us the recovering of metallic powders from recycled PCB’s waste to develop 3D printable filaments as well as developing novel solution for using recycled precious metals in jewelry.
","3D Printing and 3D scanning technologies are still evolving and are being considered innovative and lead in cost and time reduction and also in waste reduction due to the nature of the technology of using only the required material and not subtracting from a large piece of material. 3D also has no limitations in produced geometry. Traditional manufacturing methods typically require larger volumes of inventory to be produced and warehoused at one time. New innovations can be created and revised quickly since 3D printing is an iterative process. Lead times can be reduced as a result of being able to produce goods relatively quickly. Single items can be produced inexpensively without incurring the mold and tooling costs of traditional manufacturing.

Our approach has a dual nature. We are both distributors of 3D solutions and also providers of 3D services. This model has advantages for both directions. Being daily heavy users of the equipment allows us to have the hands on experience and offer unparallel support to our customers when we sell them equipment. Also our direct relationship with the manufacturers as distributors gives us access to technicians and deeper knowledge that allows us to offer our print services more efficiently. 

Other advantage over competition is the variety of materials (even biocompatible) and ease of serving all different verticals with the same equipment when in standard manuacturing this would require huge investment to change the production line.

Urban transport is a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions. How we commute and deliver goods, need to become sustainable.

bFlex is the first green mobility-as-a-service provider in Greece with as vision having cities free of transportation pollution. By offering all-inclusive, flexible subscriptions for bicycles, e-bikes, electric (kick) scooters, bFlex accelerates the transition from pollutive vehicles to sustainable ones.

Moreover, bFlex does not sell its bikes. And the reason is simple, we have the environment at heart and are therefore trying to reach a 88% circularity and thus minimising waste. A percentage that can not be reached when selling the vehicles. It is in bFlex's best interest, to prolong the life expectancy of the fleet as much as possible, ensuring the best care. Once parts of the bicycle can no longer be used, these are up cycled or recycled. Why not go for the full 100%? Certain wiring or lubricants can not be reused, e.g. WB40. ","Our user goes to our website (mobile application currently developed) and chooses their favourite model. After completing the booking and payment, which combined takes less than 2 minutes, we deliver the bike the next day to the given address. If during the subscription any issue occurs, we fix it within 24 hours. The subscription can be stopped at any time, after which we come to collect the bike.

At bFlex, we believe in flexibility as it lowers any (financial) hurdle for a commuter or company to find an alternative for their current fleet. bFlex charges no up front costs nor asks for any deposit. The terms and conditions are extensive and cover bFlex in case of loss, theft or damages. The ""City Bicycle"" subscription goes now for €14,50 per month (reduced from €19 per month due to sponsorship Eurobank). 

Our subscriptions are all-inclusive. As the cycling industry is immature in Greece, the experience and knowledge concerning bicycles are underdeveloped. With our service, we repair any issue that might occur (flat tire, broken battery, brakes) within 24 hours. Our average response rate is 2,5 hours. In case there are issues that can't be solved on the spot, we replace the vehicle with a new one. ","bFlex is the first bike subscription company in Greece. Once the software is fully developed (mobile application June 2022, booking system September 2022) bFlex can scale to other cities. Well-known short-term sharing companies like Lime and Bird need a base in each city they operate in. For bFlex ""a long-term sharing company"" it's the same. A local hub is needed with a store manager and mechanics that fix the bike when needed and make the delivery and pick up. All management will take place from the holding company. As our subscriptions are on a monthly basis, not short-term (minute/hour), the business is even less labour intensive than for example Lime and therefore easier to scale. 

As bFlex has already large clients, that are based throughout Greece, we can scale with them to other cities.","bFlex is founded in 09/20, where beforehand extensive market research has been done and a MVP build and achieved. As of today, bFlex reached the 400 subscriber milestone of which 25 companies. Since our launch, an important milestone is also the constantly extending subscribers lifetime (or CLV). Eurobank sponsored 100 of our bicycles for 2022. Gregories (coffee chain, holding company) launched a successful pilot in Glyfada using our e-bikes for the delivery of coffee and snacks. Two weeks ago Gregories Galatsi was the second store. Betty's Bakery, Coffeeberry (franchise), Fayfib, Onomataki used our fleet for deliveries. The Onassis Foundation, Grid Fox for their team (daily commute) and bike tour operators and hotels, like the Poseidon Hotel, uses our bikes to re-rent to their guests. In March 2022, bFlex won an award for the ""consumer's choice"" within the Greek cycling industry. In April 2022, Eurobank gave a bank loan of €75,000 to bFlex. ","The founder and CEO of bFlex, Robbert, cycled before he could walk. Growing up in the Netherlands, Robbert considers cycling as the most normal way to commute. Throughout his career, he has worked in 4 countries always with the focus on the environment. Both commercially, as COO of GEP Hellas, a wholly owned subsidiary of the French and listed GEP. In Australia he worked with Greenpeace, to safeguard the Great Barrier Reef. Also in Greece, Robbert has worked as project leader with WWF Hellas and CSR officer for we4all. 

Dimitris, the CTO, a through and through good guy, with 23 years of experience in software development. Dimitris is passionate, caring and very experienced putting all of that combined into bFlex.

Georgia, CMO, is eager to learn, likes to try new experiences and is just as passionate. As Georgia is from Larissa, she has a good idea of what a sustainable city should look like. Highly experienced in brand building (5 years), online marketing and has amazing people skills.

We want to expand our team further while keeping the values that bFlex stand for; Nature, Efficiency, Freedom and Creativity. Once our funding is complete, we already have the most important roles filled; Markos as lead developer, Marios as product manager, Simon/Willem as COO and Christophoros as bike mechanic.","bFlex is looking for €500,000. 86% will to go the expansion of our fleet, 7,3% software and 6,3% to the expansion of our team, marketing and others.

Based on reports, a cyber-attack on the Global Positioning System alone could cost the U.S. $1 billion a day. Our solution helps the space industry reduce the risks of cyber-attacks of their space assets, terrestrial infrastructure and data payloads enabling secure management, real-time opcode consensus, and smart governance in hybrid, no-trust environment.
The Astropledge product is comprised of two parts:
Part A: the permissioned private blockchain network and the software to be installed on ground infrastructure with the purpose of validating critical commands sent to the space asset. The software will also be responsible for validating command logs from existing space assets in-orbit and be able to verify potential “unknown” or critical commands, by comparing those commands with existing oracles in the blockchain network, and Part B: the embedded HW - basically a blockchain light-node integrated into the space asset, responsible for the local copy of the blockchain ledger and act as an authorized and trusted peer","Our solution’s unfair advantage is the blockchain technology, smart contracts, and light-node implementation for the space assets, together with the self-healing properties, provide enhanced security layer and impeccable governance models in a critical, no-trust environment. We are focusing on LEO cubesats and satellite constellations where mission operations and services are different and demand rapid decision making in a rather automated environment. 
In addition our solution is satellite- and manufacturer-agnostic and can easily be adapted in different critical industries, such as, grid, energy, oil & gas, maritime, etc.","- November 2021.

Until today, the plastic fishing and shipping gear of Greece and most of the EU countries is considered and treated as general waste. The issue remains a challenge and that constitutes a strong motive for BlueCycle, which wishes to have a substantial impact on eliminating the single use of plastic products.
Moreover, since the quality of the recycled plastic pellet is of great importance for the plastics industry, BlueCycle is focusing on providing recycled material of high quality, ready to be integrated in the industrial production.","BlueCycle implements a three-step holistic approach for handling discarded fishing and shipping gear: a) a network for the material collection (fishermen, aquacultures, shipping companies, manufacturers, NGOs’ sea & beach clean-ups), b) grading of the incoming material according to the type of plastic (nylon, polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene), washing with a state-of-the-art zero-discharge system and mechanical processing, c) production and distribution of high-quality plastic raw material (pellet) for the plastics industry, 3D printer filament and fully recyclable and traceable design furniture using cutting edge 3D printing technology, a robotic 3D-printer for large-scale production housed at BlueCycle Lab.","BlueCycle's holistic approach to plastic fishing and shipping gear waste management issue is innovative for the unique collection system which permits controlling the material’s quality and for processing all types of incoming plastic mechanically, in the most eco-friendly way including a custom-made zero-discharge washing machine. 
The recycled plastic pellet is making its way to the plastics industry, implementing the circular model, and all our recycled products are designed to be traceable and fully recyclable. The iconic ""Second Nature"" furniture line is created with a state-of-the-art equipment, in our robotic large-scale 3D printing lab, which is unique in Greece. As manufacturer, BlueCycle can create custom-made, unique products, but also can provide products in larger quantities, of around 2000 pieces. Finally, BlueCycle is transferable and scalable project.
BlueCycle intends to scale up by expanding its assets. Particularly, BlueCycle intends to install small Units in Greece in order to avoid the transportation costs and to diminish CO2 emissions. BlueCycle also plans to transfer the know-how of the holistic approach for discarded fishing and shipping gear to European countries and establish authorized branches. ","After launching BlueCycle in June 2019, a collection network for fishing and shipping plastic equipment was created and it is continues expanding. Today, BlueCycle has 24 collection points, and has formed partnerships with manufacturers of fishing and shipping gear, as well as with aquacultures. On October 2019 the BlueCycle Lab opened its doors as a dedicated space for recycling, research, designing and developing innovative products. On December 2019 the state-of-the-art robotic large-scale 3D printing lab became operational. On July 2020 the extrusion line for the production of recycled 3D printer filament and pellet was put together, a project delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic. In the same period, the R&D for the Second Nature furniture line has been concluded and the first pieces were produced.

Services and products of the company: 

1. A VR software development studio developing VR content either for consumers (B2C) either for institutional and corporate clients (B2B). It has developed over 40 VR and AR applications, including games distributed through Steam and other platforms, games based on exploration of cultural heritage and a large number of corporate VR promotion software

2. Introducing the Greek public to the technology of immersive, room-scale VR via the flagship initiative “The VR Project”, a VR showcase center. It has been visited by thousands of people, hundreds of schools, and delivered VR art seminars and exhibitions 

3. Organising VR promotion and educational events with its mobile VR systems by fusing the services above and by adding value added services for private and corporate clients

4. Participating in European and national research Projects that expand the scope and use of eXtended reality technologies, incl. from the Horizon 2020 programme.","A niche market has developed for XR in 1) industrial training for firms/organisations in a number of fields, and 2) in informal training and experiential learning edutainment for museums/cultural centers and informal education providers. There is a gap in the provision of such training mainly because of lack of material/content. XR content developers are focused on other fields and end-users have not yet discovered the potential of the technology. Training in XR involves expensive and custom content and is often restricted by hardware price and not cross-interface.

We have already created content for VR training in the said sectors involving single-user and multi-user interfaces across hardware formats including major players Oculus, Vive and Windows Mixed Reality. We have an in-house, growing Asset and API library and know-how for the mechanics required for successful implementation. We have built specific scenarios for various training modules in both sectors defined above.

In this context, we are now putting together experience gained and creating an end-to-end VR training platform solution for industrial training, informal & experiential learning. The platform will bring together the roots of the learning process, instructional design and ROIs of training programs and apply them to the new technology. It will be fully scalable, providing all tools for end users to create scenarios, 3D environments, interactions, training reports etc. ","There is a large niche for our products as defined above and as we have already developed in previous projects. Currently, XR training can cost firms from 20.000 Euro and up per module for the software alone. We aim to cut this cost in half with our Platform which will provide end users with all tools necessary to scale the training within their organization. This coupled with continuous reductions in cost and increase in quality of VR hardware will continue to ignite interest for XR training and learning.
The production line has been set up to assure distinct units and scalability for growth:

1) Team of artists/developers/training experts to create a large number of training and experiential learning scenarios using our Asset and API libraries, our storyboard and scenario libraries in our SDK. These tools will also be open for end users to use alone with tech support.
2) Customer service via service and tech support during training implementation where each developer/account manager will be charged with a number of customers to which they will continuously provide assistance.
Adding new developers/account managers as revenue and sales increase, especially given the excellent level of human capital in Athens, will not hinder production given the automation that will be developed in our platform architecture. Growth is subject to end-users adopting the new technology and realizing its potential, something that is more and more plausible giving the ever maturing XR market.","Established in 2016, we are already a brand name in the XR ecosystem in Greece, having taking part in numerous print, television and radio media presentations, and also several trade shows and academic conferences.

The combination of a high experienced team enhanced with high expertise and state-of-the-art facilities, provides a Fine House with the competitive advantage of being one of the first CDMOs globally to develop and manufacture oncological added value medicines in oral solution forms. The company consists of a brand-new highly efficient laboratory dedicated to the analytical development, which will be supported by robust quality systems, ensuring at the same time the high level of the company’s services.","The differentiation strategy is based on the uniqueness of our products (anti-cancer/ oral liquid dosage forms). a Fine House’s high potent products offer the best opportunity to achieve satisfactory uniformity and minimize the risk of exposure to the operator. In addition, these products will allow individualized dosage titration – administration. Palatability studies will also be conducted, and existing pill burden has also been taken into consideration. Patients require drug administration through tube feeding; a liquid dosage form is imperative to overcome shortcomings of currently marketed solid formulations. Dose titration as well as fine dose tuning are particularly important in such treatments. All Fine House’s products will have pediatric/elderly – friendly formulations. Fine House’s approach provides a versatile solution for safe and effective handling of highly potent and other complex API – Scale up is a straightforward contingent upon development that has been conducted appropriately, due to the consistency of liquid handling mechanisms. Fine House is also offering a proven approach to overcome many of the challenges associated with the development, scale-up and commercial manufacturing for those highly potent API (HPAPI), from safer handling to manufacturing more accurately dosed and homogeneous formulations for anticancer products.","a Fine House will implement its business model into the extremely promising sector of “high-potent” medicines (in the oncology segment, starting with oral solid forms), where a very strong demand for developments is not currently met. For the time being, there are very few independent R&D labs / CMOs which can address the highly stringent requirements for handling and containment of the HPAPIs and the KPIs of sponsors. Starting imminently, a Fine House plans to dedicate a high-potent lab and a small scale (25-30 kg) manufacturing capacity for IMP & registration batches (target granting of the GMP license in Q4/2022). A Fine House has already started  the formulation and analytical development for some of its high-potent anticancer generic which will be completed in Q3/2022 and will  submit the dossier for registration in Q2/2023. At the same time, the company will also expand into the commercial scale manufacturing of high potent pharmaceutical products in the form of oral solutions and suspensions that will be intended exclusively for pharmaceutical use. This is a strategic investment in cutting-edge technology and processes, bolstered by lean techniques and safety innovations. The expansion adds both additional capacity and new capabilities in applied R&D and manufacturing.",Despite that a Fine House was established in December 2021 it has significant number of ongoing projects. The company has four under development products which are currently in the prototype’s phase and are attracting significant interest from companies to acquire them. These four products are going to be followed by another four until the end of the year. The company has already participated in a major pharma business event in which interest from key players in the pharma industry has already been generated.,"a Fine House is operated by Senior Pharma Executives and supported by a Board of Advisors, who provide significant industry experience as well as access to extensive network of experts and key opinion leaders on pharmaceutical industry and healthcare business in general. The company was established in 2021 and employs 10 highly educated and experienced people. Senior Management team and Heads of R&D pair more than 25 years of expertise in pharmaceutical development to assess, identify and help potential customers discover added value (i.e., unique formulations, new strengths, or drug combinations). ","Development fees, paid by sponsors for R&D / CRO / registration services. These are pre-agreed, based on a budget, plus a mark-up.
•Licensing fees, i.e., one-off payments from clients against obtaining specific IP rights (dossiers, territories, time); these relate either to the company’s own IP portfolio or available IP rights on products developed on behalf of sponsors.
•Royalties. These apply in case clients acquire  IP rights over a specific product and are calculated as a percentage of the Net Selling Price of all products sold in the relevant territories; 
•Production revenue. Typically, a Fine House works with a 10% mark up on the agreed Supply Price with clients.

Digital age is here. Most consumers have already adjusted to digital advertising, consuming, rewarding and even more they demand it. Merchant must adjust too, otherwise they are slowly dying. However, the transition to digital age is not easy at all, as it seems. Most cases –market solutions – are too expensive, too complicated, technical infrastructure is needed, technical know how required and the most important the result is either unreliable or long-term. Therefore, merchants become disoriented by the several market solutions and even worse merchants need to rely to more than one company / solution in order to have a full 360 service regarding digital presence in market. Merchants need desperately a solution that brings almost instantly profit through digital world. Booms has successfully identified this crucial problem in depth and offers a digital Loyalty & Marketing suite designed to solve all these issues on behalf of merchant, at once.","BOOMS’s solution is to offer to merchants a customizable package of digital services which are competitive cheap, fully flexible and easy to use, no technical infrastructure and know required, no technical, increase profit instantly and most of all merchant owners do not need to spend their precious time to run them. More specifically these services are designed to be offered through a specified methodology and are divided to the following three sections:
1.tBOOMS.Reward: a cloud based loyalty and marketing platform.
2.tBOOMS.Connect: It works with BOOMS.Reward, an effective and easy to use Online marketing tool that allows businesses to run online campaigns, promos and interact with customers. 
3.tBOOMS.Attract:  attract is like an inhouse adverting agency for Social Media strategy and content creation in house, only cheaper.
","Our services are not only innovative but also productive and instantly effective. Our innovation is applied both in technology used for our digital tools and also in our business approach/model. Specifically regarding, technology our main innovation is that we have created a digital marketing tool-kit that has embedded all 3 basic and important steps that a merchant needs to enter digital world, into one friendly and easy-use UI. These steps are: 1) customer subscribing, 2) customer rewarding, 3) customer interactive communication and what differentiates us from the rest of the market solution - besides that all steps are under one ""roof"" - is also our business approach towards merchants that has the following 3 fundamental principles: 1) very cheap SAAS economic model, 2) daily merchant support, 3) fully flexible and easy to use, 4) no technical infrastructure and know-how required, 5) increase profit instantly and 6) most of all merchant owners do not need to spend their precious time to run them as we do it for them.","Our company is commercially operating the last 2-3 years. Our services are offered almost to 20 brands – small and small/medium merchants with about 50 branches. BOOMS is already a fresh start-up business with strong foundations having the last 3 years overcome the childhood problems that start-ups usually face in the first years and we are already enjoying the loyalty and satisfaction of the merchants we serve. Our clients effectively use our services and thus they have managed to engage into digital era and raise their profits. Furthermore, our company, within 2020 managed to have a successful business start in USA serving already 7 more merchants and feeling proud for setting a very promising business development. Even more, what makes us proud is that we have created and gain our technological and business expertise through our strong effort of being close to our clients’ struggle for business survival and development. At last, all these achievements would not be easy without our effective and productive team and without our strong will for being creative.","BOOMS' s services are mainly - but not limited - designed to assist small and medium retail merchants. Specifically, merchants that cannot afford (economically wise, infrastructure wise and time wise) to adjust to digital age. The number of merchants that struggle for profit due to either their disorientation regarding offered solutions, as well as, due to their ""business incapability"" to adjust to digital age is growing extremely fast. The main reasons for this fast increasing is first of all, most digital solutions companies lack of the deep understanding that the real problem is not the low percentage of technology apply but the merchant daily support in applying such digital solutions. Furthermore, taking into consideration the general deficit that is taking part for a long period now, it boosts the number even more high. In simple words, it is an extremely fast-growing market that BOOMS' s services can be offered. Additionally, our services because are cloud based have no geographic limitations. In simple words, our strategy is as simple as out honest and humble intention to assist merchants’ struggle to adapt fast digital era and also fast and effectively increase their profits. We believe that the best growth strategy is working hard, being honest and offering an effective service. In fast changing word, growth strategy must be flexible and able to adapt. At last, nothing of all the above would be easy unless we could count on our our effective and productive team.","As we have already mentioned and described our services have no geographic limitations; therefore, they can be offered all over Greece and abroad. Consequently, the potentiality of our growth is ""limit is the sky"". However, what we consider that it might be a barrier for this potentiality is not to get in the right time, the right funding that companies need when they come to the point to boost their business. BOOMS is a company that has overcome all ""child issues"" that all start-ups face. Even better, we have deployed our services to more than 20 merchants with more than 50 branches and our effort has already gain the compliments by these merchants of how much effective we are and how much we have already assisted them in their business struggle. We have come to critical point regarding Business Development that we believe that a fund assist would allow us to increase our resources (both human and technical) and boost our potentiality and get to next level.",,,,,Seed,NA

The industry of Reinforced Concrete(RC) building construction [about 50% of the global building construction material market] has always been facing the problem of how to do precise and correct calculations and estimations of all the needed materials. It is a matter of safety and integrity, but also of cost, because the materials will be purchased based on those calculations. Mistakes are usually a result of human negligence. It is hard to find trusted intermediates to order the materials from find and there is a lot of hassle to be dealt with, making the arrival of the materials late and costly. The industry/manufacturers are dealing with their own problems. They maintain a costly special department equipped with highly experienced engineers and foremen, in charge of checking and correcting the possibly faulty plans and catalogues of the responsible engineer. Also, the industry indirectly accepts the responsibility of the possible omissions that are bound to happen.
","HoloBIM is an elegant tool for structural analysis of a building, automatically calculating not only the building material but mainly the structural materials, who require complicated calculations. That is what makes holoBIM stand out from worldwide competitors. Furthermore, it has a unique feature that allows the direct online order of all the materials directly from the manufacturer. Like an e-shop for construction materials- comparing prices and technologies. Thanks to a web placed order, the engineer/contractor has control over the process, saving money and credibility. From the manufacturer’s point of view, this new feature can be very beneficial because: A) Web orders solve the issue of their legal vulnerability mentioned before, by making the terms of responsibility very clear and by dealing directly with the contractor/engineer B) Besides selling directly and without intermediates, manufacturers can use the program to register their products.","We have a functional BIM software that comes with two modules, who are a true implementation of the BIM technology. We want to provide the engineers and contractors, with a direct channel for online automated purchase of construction materials, bypassing costly and time consuming intermediate routes. We are introducing a worldwide breakthrough. Automated online ordering of the construction materials, via web order placement. This feature is not to be found anywhere else, globally. We know the market and we know that this is a much needed upgrade that will eventually take over.
Our software is written in C ++ and OpenGL. 
We can scale up our business in the following steps:
The first step: fully turning HoloBIM to SaaS (Software as a Service). This feature will facilitate the use of the software, by making it “lightweight” and easy to use anywhere. It will give us new international clientele of students and young engineers.
Current step: AWS (Amazon Web Services) supports us with significant credit and high-quality infrastructure and marketing experts. We run through Appstream on any browser (chrome, safari, mozilla firefox, edge etc.) and on any operating system (Windows, Mac OS, Linux).
The second step: Further growth, expansion of the e-ordering, strategic marketing, and customization of the software. ","As a startup we had an initial budget of 20000 and through hard pay-less work of the founding members we have managed to have had huge interest through the internet. With a mere cost of 2000 euros for advertising, in 2020 alone (1st of January-24 of December) our webpage has attracted more than 176,000 unique visitors out of which only 15 % were Greek Engineers. That however, translates to 26,000 engineers which is around the 40% of Greek Structural Engineers. The rest is 23% Indian engineers (40,000 individual users), 7.5 % engineers from the USA (13,000 individual users), 5,4 % from the Philippines (9,500 individual users), etc. 5,500 people have downloaded the promotional version of our program. Also, we have had contact with major giants of the construction world that have shown interest in our product. Examples are the ACI (American Concrete Institute) and the Greek manufacturers “Hellenic Halyvourgia” and ΤΙΤΑΝ.","Vasileios Giannopoulos: Our main programmer, a civil engineer with lots of experience in the subject of finite elements.
Konstantinos Anastasiadis: An architect and graphic designer specialized in 3D objects
Aikaterini Konstantinidi: Civil engineering student, administrative manager 
Andreas Moutsanas: Administrative support 
Tatiani Konstantinidi: Chemist, managing director 
Konstantinos Lyrakis: Programmer and civil engineering student.
Apostolos Konstantinidis: The ""visionary"" of the group is a well-established civil and software engineer, author with international patents. He is an advisor of the team on scientific matters. His books on antiseismic concrete buildings have made him well known in his field in Greece and have even gained the interest of the ACI. 
We also have many talented engineers for develloping and others for consulting, like John Bellos, Associate Professor of Structural Design and Construction in the Neapolis University of Cyprus, who have great experience in software engineering.
","Our needs are :
•€2.5 mil for the first phase: 
a) Creating an 'AutoLISP type' programming environment with which our clients may customize the program to their specific needs and region regulations.
b) Promote the BIM and AI technology of HoloBIM in the international construction industry market for structural design and construction.
•€7.5 mil for the second phase: 
Promotion and marketing of the HoloBIM specifically for e-ordering of construction materials for earthquake-resistant buildings in the international market.

The real life team behind the service are highly-trained professionals, ready to respond to travellers’ requests instantly and provide suggestions tailored to their taste. A cutting edge customer service system allows Butlairs to be fast & efficient. At the same time we are building bots to handle “easy” requests (timetables, public transportation etc.) to free up experts for more subjective work.

Butlair wants to make travel more humane and give travellers a peace of mind, not with mechanical responses but through real humans with knowledge about whatever a traveller needs.
More time to enjoy a delicious breakfast, to swim in an empty beach, to dance, to explore, to create long lasting memories.

- Travellers seek for authentic local experiences “78% millennials would spend more on a desirable experiences over buying something desirable.”1
- Overload of information on tourism/ Valuable information is offline - difficult to find information when abroad “Too many choices increased consumers making ‘no choice’2
- Boom of Instant Message Apps Worldwide “Over 3.5 billion active monthly users”
- Post App Economy - Rise of Instant Message Services “ 79% of time on their mobile phone using five apps”

Using instant messaging applications our services are accessible to everyone having a smartphone. The service is not dependant on an application but on Instant Messaging apps that everyone already has on their phones. Especially downloading of ""travel apps"" is not so frequent and most travellers avoid it. Our service is based on the content it provides to travellers and the experience of talking to a local. We believe that a platform with selected locals and curated information where travellers can sign up and discuss about their travel is an experience that we lack right now. In order for this solution to expand we need to provide our platform to multiple travel destinations as all other parts of the service are already there. ","1.
